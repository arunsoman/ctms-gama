## **1. Core Domain**
These subsystems represent the essential business logic that defines the AML system's value.

1. **Fraud Detection Engine**  
   - Detects suspicious activities and patterns in transactions, behavior, and networks.  

2. **Fraudulent Activity Module**  
   - Manages confirmed fraud cases, tracks actions, and provides feedback for refinement.  

3. **Alert Management Module**  
   - Central repository for ingesting, categorizing, and managing alerts.

   - Provides visual analytics for transaction patterns, alerts, and case statuses.  

3. **Case Management Module**  
   - Tracks and manages the lifecycle of investigations into flagged activities.  

4. **Data Normalization and Validation Module**  
   - Prepares data for downstream processing by enforcing schema and removing duplicates.  

5. **Threat Intelligence Module**  
   - Integrates external feeds, such as sanctions lists and adverse media, to enhance risk evaluation.  

6. **Big Data Processing Module**  
   - Handles the ingestion, transformation, and storage of large volumes of data.  

7. **Real-Time Analytics Engine**  
   - Processes real-time transaction data to identify risks immediately.
