# Case Management Module

## Overview

### What is the Case Management Module?
The **Case Management Module** is the central hub for managing, investigating, and resolving fraud and AML-related cases. It provides tools for tracking the lifecycle of suspicious activities, coordinating investigations, and maintaining a detailed audit trail of actions taken. This module ensures regulatory compliance by enabling systematic documentation and reporting of all cases.

### Benefits of the Case Management Module
1. **Structured Investigations**: Organizes and tracks all case-related data in one place.
2. **Collaboration**: Facilitates investigator collaboration with role-based access and task assignment.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to AML regulations through detailed audit logs and case documentation.
4. **Insights for Detection Refinement**: Provides outcomes and feedback to detection systems for improving accuracy.
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates reports for internal use and regulatory submissions.

## Scope

The **Case Management Module** encompasses the following responsibilities:
1. **Case Creation**:
   - Automatically or manually create cases from alerts generated by detection systems.
2. **Investigation Tracking**:
   - Maintain the status, progress, and actions taken during investigations.
3. **Task Assignment and Collaboration**:
   - Assign cases to investigators and enable team collaboration.
4. **Audit and Documentation**:
   - Maintain a detailed record of case activities and outcomes.
5. **Regulatory Reporting**:
   - Generate Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and other compliance documents.

    - Linked alerts and transactions.
    - Associated customers and accounts.
    - Severity level and priority.

---

### 2. **Investigation Tracking**
- **Case Lifecycle Management**:
  - Track case status (e.g., New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).

  - Display all associated data, including:
    - Alerts from the **Alert Management Module**.
    - Transactions from the **Transaction Repository**.
    - Customer profiles from the **Customer Information Repository**.
- **Progress Updates**:
  - Allow investigators to log actions, findings, and updates during the investigation.

---

### 3. **Task Assignment and Collaboration**
- **Role-Based Assignments**:
  - Assign cases to individual investigators or investigation teams.
- **Collaboration Tools**:
  - Enable investigators to share notes, attach documents, and communicate within the case system.
- **Workload Balancing**:
  - Distribute cases based on investigator workloads or expertise.

---

### 4. **Audit and Documentation**
- **Activity Logs**:
  - Maintain an immutable record of all actions taken on a case.
  - Include timestamps, user details, and descriptions of activities.
- **Case Outcomes**:
  - Document resolutions, such as:
    - Verified Fraud.
    - False Positive.
    - Escalation to Regulators.
- **Compliance Tracking**:
  - Ensure all steps taken adhere to regulatory requirements.

---

### 5. **Regulatory Reporting**
- **SAR Templates**:
  - Generate pre-filled Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with case details.
- **Customizable Reports**:
  - Create reports tailored to specific regulatory frameworks or internal requirements.
- **Submission Tracking**:
  - Log when and to whom regulatory reports are submitted.

---

### 2. **Fraud Detection Engine**
- **Input**:
  - Provides resolved case outcomes to refine detection logic.
- **Output**:
  - Uses flagged transactions and alerts to link cases.

---

### 3. **Customer Information Repository**
- **Input**:
  - Fetches customer profiles, risk scores, and linked accounts for case context.
- **Output**:
  - Updates risk profiles based on case outcomes.

---

### 4. **Transaction Repository**
- **Input**:
  - Retrieves transaction data linked to cases.
- **Output**:
  - Flags transactions involved in resolved fraud cases.

---

### 5. **Link Analysis Module**
- **Input**:
  - Visualizes relationships and connections between entities in a case.
- **Output**:
  - Provides enriched insights for complex fraud investigations.

---

### 6. **Insights Dashboard**
- **Input**:
  - Displays case statuses, outcomes, and investigative progress.
- **Output**:
  - Allows investigators to initiate actions directly from the dashboard.

---

### 7. **AML Knowledge Repository**
- **Input**:
  - Retrieves rules and typologies associated with cases.
- **Output**:
  - Updates rules and typologies based on resolved case outcomes.

---

## Example Workflow

### 1. Case Creation
- **Automatic**:
  - An alert from the Fraud Detection Engine triggers a new case:
    ```json
    {
        "alertId": "A001",
        "type": "High-Value Transaction",
        "linkedTransactions": ["T123", "T456"],
        "linkedCustomer": "C001",
        "severity": "Critical"
    }
    ```

- **Manual**:
  - An investigator creates a new case for an external report:
    ```json
    {
        "caseId": "C002",
        "description": "Third-party report of suspicious activity.",
        "linkedCustomer": "C002",
        "status": "New"
    }
    ```

### 2. Investigation
- Investigator accesses the case and retrieves linked data:
  - **Customer Details**:
    - Name: John Doe.
    - Risk Score: 85 (High Risk).
  - **Transactions**:
    - T123: $15,000.
    - T456: $20,000.
  - **Alerts**:
    - A001: High-Value Transaction.
  - **Network**:
    - Linked to sanctioned entities in the Link Analysis Module.

### 3. Resolution
- Investigator marks the case as resolved:
  ```json
  {
      "caseId": "C001",
      "status": "Resolved",
      "outcome": "Verified Fraud",
      "actions": [
          "Account A001 frozen.",
          "Reported to regulator."
      ]
  }
  ```

- Feedback sent to the Fraud Detection Engine:
  ```json
  {
      "alertId": "A001",
      "status": "Resolved",
      "feedback": "True Positive"
  }
  ```
