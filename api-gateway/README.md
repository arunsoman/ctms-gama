# API Gateway Module

## Overview

### What is the API Gateway Module?
The **API Gateway Module** acts as the central entry point for all client requests and inter-module communication in the AML system. It provides a unified interface for accessing system functionalities, manages authentication and authorization, enforces request validation, and ensures secure and efficient routing of API calls.

### Benefits of the API Gateway
1. **Centralized Access Control**: Simplifies security management by centralizing authentication and authorization.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests efficiently across backend services.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protects the system from abuse by limiting API usage.
4. **Request Validation and Transformation**: Ensures incoming requests meet system requirements and formats.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Tracks API usage and performance for auditing and optimization.

---

## Scope

The **API Gateway Module** encompasses the following responsibilities:
1. **Request Routing**:
   - Direct incoming requests to the appropriate backend services.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Validate client credentials and enforce role-based access control.
3. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
   - Protect services from excessive or malicious requests.
4. **Traffic Management**:
   - Handle load balancing, failover, and service discovery.
5. **Request Transformation**:
   - Modify incoming requests and responses as needed (e.g., formatting, header injection).
6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Track request metrics and provide detailed logs for debugging and auditing.

## Features and Functionalities

### 1. **Request Routing**
- **Service Mapping**:
  - Route requests to specific modules such as:
    - **Fraud Detection Engine**: `/api/fraud-detection`
    - **Case Management Module**: `/api/case-management`
    - **Insights Dashboard**: `/api/insights`
- **Dynamic Routing**:
  - Use service discovery to dynamically map requests to healthy instances.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully handle failed requests and provide meaningful error messages.

---

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Token Validation**:
  - Validate JWT or OAuth tokens for secure access.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Enforce permissions based on user roles (e.g., Investigator, Compliance Officer).
- **Integration with Identity Provider**:
  - Connect to an external identity provider (e.g., OAuth, LDAP) for user authentication.

---

### 3. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- **API Rate Limiting**:
  - Restrict the number of requests per client to prevent abuse.
- **IP-Based Throttling**:
  - Limit requests from specific IPs or geographies.
- **Custom Quotas**:
  - Define API usage limits per client or API key.

---

### 4. **Traffic Management**
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Distribute requests evenly across backend services to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Failover Mechanism**:
  - Redirect requests to backup services in case of failures.
- **Service Discovery**:
  - Automatically discover and route to active services using a registry (e.g., Consul, Eureka).

---

### 5. **Request Transformation**
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate request payloads against predefined schemas.
- **Response Transformation**:
  - Modify responses to match client requirements or hide sensitive data.
- **Header Management**:
  - Add, modify, or remove request/response headers.

---

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Request Metrics**:
  - Track metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates.
- **Audit Logs**:
  - Record details of all API requests and responses for compliance and debugging.
- **Integration with Monitoring Tools**:
  - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack for real-time monitoring.

  POST /api/fraud-detection/analyze
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```
  Payload:
  ```json
  {
      "transactionId": "T001",
      "amount": 10000,
      "sourceAccountId": "A001",

  }
  ```

- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
      "alertId": "A123",
      "riskScore": 85,
      "status": "High-Risk"
  }
  ```

---

### 2. Case Management Request
- **Request**:
  ```http
  GET /api/case-management/cases?status=open
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
  ```

- **Response**:
  ```json
  [
      {
          "caseId": "C001",
          "status": "Open",
