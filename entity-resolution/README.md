# Entity Resolution Engine
Entity resolution (ER) is a critical subsystem in an AML system, responsible for identifying, unifying, and deduplicating entities across multiple data sources to create a single, accurate, and comprehensive view of individuals, organizations, and transactions. Below is a deeper dive into the **Entity Resolution Engine**, including its architecture, features, and specific services:

## Services Provided:

1. **Entity Matching Services**: Resolve duplicates and inconsistencies in customer profiles across FIs.
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Identify relationships between entities, such as shared addresses or phone numbers.
3. **Cross-FI Linking**: Unify profiles from multiple FIs for the same individual or organization.
4. **Alias Detection**: Detect alias usage or name variations (e.g., John Doe vs. J. Doe).
5. **Scoring Relationships**: Assign scores to relationships based on their likelihood of being suspicious.

### **1. Key Objectives of Entity Resolution**
- **De-duplication**: Eliminate duplicate records within and across financial institutions (FIs).
- **Entity Unification**: Consolidate data points related to the same entity (e.g., customer, organization) into a single profile.
- **Relationship Discovery**: Identify and link relationships between entities based on common attributes.
- **Alias Detection**: Resolve entities using variations of names, addresses, or identifiers.

---

### **2. Core Functionalities**
1. **Data Matching and Similarity Scoring**:
   - Use advanced algorithms (fuzzy matching, phonetic similarity, edit distance, etc.) to identify matches between records.
   - Assign similarity scores to potential matches to determine confidence levels.

2. **Identity Resolution**:
   - Combine data from different sources (e.g., customer data from multiple banks) to create unified customer profiles.
   - Detect and merge records that share similar identifiers (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, account numbers).

3. **Relationship Mapping**:
   - Identify direct and indirect relationships (e.g., shared addresses, phone numbers, or transactions).
   - Link entities involved in suspicious transactions, enabling network analysis.

4. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Resolve conflicting information (e.g., different addresses for the same customer) using configurable rules and source reliability scoring.

5. **Alias Management**:
   - Detect aliases and variations in names (e.g., "John Doe," "J. Doe") using linguistic and cultural name-matching techniques.
   - Identify fake identities created by altering key attributes.

6. **Cross-System Integration**:
   - Integrate with external systems like government databases, sanctions lists, and third-party services to enrich and verify entity data.
