### **Additional Notes:**
1. **Hierarchy Enforcement**:
   - Roles like System Administrator and Regulatory Auditor should have the highest permissions, but within their defined scope.
   - Permissions for roles like Analyst and Investigator should be limited to their specific workflows.

2. **Granular Permissions**:
   - For roles like Investigator, ensure permissions are granular, e.g., "view entity details," "attach evidence," "escalate case."
   - For roles like FI Data Submitter, permissions should focus strictly on data submission and error resolution.

3. **Permission Overlap**:
   - Overlap permissions only where collaboration is required, e.g., Rule Manager and System Admin both need access to rule configurations.
