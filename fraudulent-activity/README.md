   # Fraudulent Activity Repository

## Services Provided:

1. **Suspicious Case Database**: Store details of all flagged and confirmed fraudulent activities.
2. **Known Patterns Repository**: Maintain a repository of previously identified fraud patterns.
3. **Historical Case Insights**: Provide investigators with access to resolved cases for reference and analysis.
4. **Case Linking Services**: Link new suspicious activities to related historical cases for deeper insights.
5. **Repository Search Tools**: Enable quick and advanced searches across stored fraudulent activity data.


### **Scope Difference: Fraud Detection Module vs. Fraudulent Activity Module**

#### **1. Fraud Detection Module**
The **Fraud Detection Module** focuses on identifying and flagging potential fraud within the system. It is the first line of defense, responsible for real-time and batch analysis of transactions and behaviors to detect anomalies.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Real-Time Detection**:
  - Analyzes incoming transactions and events as they occur.
  - Flags suspicious activities based on predefined rules, machine learning models, and external data sources (e.g., blacklists).
- **Batch Analysis**:
  - Processes historical transaction data to uncover fraud patterns and trends.
- **Rule Management**:
  - Provides mechanisms for administrators to define and update fraud detection rules dynamically.
- **Output**:
  - Generates alerts for flagged transactions.
  - Provides fraud detection metrics (e.g., detection accuracy, false positives).

**Use Case:**
- Trigger alerts for transactions that violate fraud detection criteria, such as high-value transfers or anomalous geospatial activity.

#### **2. Fraudulent Activity Module**
The **Fraudulent Activity Module** takes over after the Fraud Detection Module has flagged potential fraud. It is responsible for managing, investigating, and resolving suspected fraudulent activities.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Case Management**:
  - Converts flagged alerts into cases for investigation.
  - Tracks the lifecycle of fraud cases (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved).
- **Investigation Tools**:
  - Provides interfaces for investigators to review and analyze flagged activities.
  - Links related data (e.g., accounts, devices, transactions) to provide a 360-degree view.
- **Analytics and Reporting**:
  - Generates detailed reports on fraudulent activities, resolutions, and investigator actions.
  - Tracks resolution metrics (e.g., average resolution time, success rate).
- **Integration**:
  - Collaborates with Alert Management and Case Management systems.
- **Output**:
  - Resolved fraud cases.
  - Insights into fraud trends and investigator performance.

**Use Case:**
- Investigate a flagged transaction to determine if it is fraudulent or a false positive and resolve the case appropriately.

| Feature/Aspect              | Fraud Detection Module                          | Fraudulent Activity Module                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus**           | Identifying potential fraud in transactions or behaviors. | Managing and resolving suspected fraudulent activities. |
| **Input**                   | Transaction data, account metadata, external data sources. | Alerts and flagged transactions from the Fraud Detection Module. |
| **Output**                  | Alerts and flagged transactions.               | Resolved cases, fraud investigation insights.  |
| **Users**                   | System, administrators (rule configuration).   | Investigators, compliance officers.            |
| **Tools**                   | Rules engine, machine learning, real-time analysis. | Case management system, investigation dashboards. |
| **Scope**                   | Detection and prevention.                      | Investigation, resolution, and reporting.      |

#### **Example Interaction Between Modules**

1. **Fraud Detection Module** flags a transaction as suspicious (e.g., multiple high-value transactions from a blacklisted device).
2. The **Fraudulent Activity Module**:
   - Converts the alert into a case.
   - Assigns the case to an investigator for review.
   - Links additional data, such as the involved account’s history and associated devices, for context.
   - Tracks the investigator’s findings and resolution actions.

Together, these modules form a comprehensive fraud management system, where the Fraud Detection Module acts as the sentinel, and the Fraudulent Activity Module handles in-depth investigations and resolutions.
