# Threat Intelligence Module

## Overview

### What is Threat Intelligence?
**Threat Intelligence** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and applying information about potential threats, such as money laundering activities, fraud schemes, and high-risk entities. This module integrates external intelligence feeds, sanctions lists, watchlists, and adverse media to proactively identify and mitigate risks in the AML system.

### Benefits of Threat Intelligence in AML
1. **Proactive Risk Identification**: Detect high-risk entities and suspicious patterns before they escalate.
2. **Enhanced Detection Accuracy**: Correlate external intelligence with internal data for comprehensive risk profiling.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to AML regulations by using up-to-date sanctions and PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) lists.
4. **Rapid Response to Emerging Threats**: Adapt to new money laundering typologies and fraud schemes in real-time.
5. **Contextual Insights**: Provide investigators with enriched context for flagged cases.

## Services Provided

1. **Sanctions and Watchlist Integration**: Fetch and update external lists of high-risk entities.
2. **Adverse Media Screening**: Identify entities linked to negative news or criminal activities.
3. **Threat Feed Aggregation**: Consolidate intelligence feeds from multiple sources for analysis.
4. **Threat Correlation and Enrichment**: Correlate external intelligence with internal data.
5. **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Adjust risk scores based on external threat intelligence.
6. **Integration with AML Knowledge Repository**: Update and retrieve threat-based rules and typologies.

## Integration with AML Knowledge Repository

The **Threat Intelligence Module** relies on the **AML Knowledge Repository** for storing, managing, and applying threat-related rules and typologies.

### How It Works
1. **Rule Retrieval**:
   - Access repository rules that incorporate threat intelligence, such as:
     - "Flag entities appearing on sanctions lists."
     - "Increase risk score for accounts linked to adverse media."
   - Use typologies to identify threats, such as:
     - Frequent transactions with blacklisted regions.
     - Links to entities flagged in negative media.

2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Periodically update repository rules and thresholds based on new intelligence.
   - Example: Add a new rule for "Flagging transactions with entities recently added to sanctions lists."

3. **Threat-Based Typologies**:
   - Enrich typologies with insights from threat feeds (e.g., patterns involving high-risk jurisdictions).
   - Example: Update "Layering" typology to include new techniques identified in threat intelligence feeds.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Share insights on detected threats with the repository to refine detection capabilities.

---

### 5. **Dynamic Risk Scoring**
   - **Score Adjustment**:
     - Dynamically adjust customer and transaction risk scores based on threat intelligence.
   - **Weight-Based Modeling**:
     - Use repository-configured weights for different intelligence sources (e.g., sanctions lists vs. adverse media).
   - **Composite Risk Evaluation**:
     - Combine internal risk factors with external intelligence for holistic scoring.

---

### 6. **Threat Intelligence Dashboard**
   - **Visualization**:
     - Display threat trends, flagged entities, and intelligence feed statuses.
   - **Real-Time Alerts**:
     - Notify investigators of newly flagged entities or threats.
   - **Filtering and Drill-Down**:
     - Allow filtering by source, region, or type of threat (e.g., sanctions, adverse media).
