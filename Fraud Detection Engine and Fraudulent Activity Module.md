# Interaction Between Fraud Detection Engine and Fraudulent Activity Module

## Overview

### Fraud Detection Engine
The **Fraud Detection Engine** is responsible for processing real-time and batch data to detect suspicious activities using predefined rules, typologies, and machine learning models. Its primary role is to analyze transactions, customer behaviors, and networks for anomalies that align with known fraudulent patterns.

### Fraudulent Activity Module
The **Fraudulent Activity Module** acts as a centralized system for managing, investigating, and documenting detected fraud cases. It provides tools for analyzing flagged activities, assigning investigations, and maintaining an audit trail of actions taken.

---

## Key Responsibilities

### **Fraud Detection Engine**
- **Primary Functions**:
  - Analyze real-time and batch data for suspicious patterns.
  - Apply predefined rules and typologies (e.g., circular fund transfers, smurfing).
  - Score transactions and customer behaviors based on risk factors.
  - Trigger alerts for potential fraud cases.
- **Output**:
  - Alerts linked to transactions, customers, and entities.
  - Risk scores and anomaly metadata.

---

### **Fraudulent Activity Module**
- **Primary Functions**:
  - Receive and manage alerts from the Fraud Detection Engine.
  - Provide a case management system for investigating alerts.
  - Maintain a record of actions taken (e.g., assigned investigator, resolved status).
  - Generate reports for compliance and regulatory submissions.
- **Output**:
  - Investigative status of cases.
  - Resolved and unresolved fraud cases.
  - Detailed audit logs.

---

## Interaction Workflow

### 1. Alert Generation by Fraud Detection Engine
- The Fraud Detection Engine generates alerts based on suspicious activity detected in:
  - Transactions (e.g., unusual amounts, high frequency).
  - Customer behavior (e.g., deviation from norms).
  - Network relationships (e.g., links to sanctioned entities).
- Alerts are categorized by type, severity, and associated rules or typologies.

### 2. Alert Forwarding to Fraudulent Activity Module
- Alerts are forwarded to the Fraudulent Activity Module via APIs or messaging queues.
- Metadata included with the alert:
  - Type of anomaly detected (e.g., circular fund transfer).
  - Linked entities (e.g., customer IDs, accounts, transactions).
  - Severity level and confidence score.

### 3. Case Creation in Fraudulent Activity Module
- The Fraudulent Activity Module creates a case for each alert or aggregates multiple related alerts into a single case.
- Case metadata includes:
  - Linked alerts, transactions, and customers.
  - Initial findings from the Fraud Detection Engine.

### 4. Investigation and Resolution
- Investigators analyze the case using:
  - Insights from the Fraud Detection Engine.
  - Additional tools like the **Insights Dashboard** and **Link Analysis Module**.
- Actions taken (e.g., freezing accounts, escalating to regulators) are recorded.

### 5. Feedback Loop to Fraud Detection Engine
- Resolved cases provide feedback to improve detection accuracy:
  - Confirmed fraud cases are used to refine rules and retrain machine learning models.
  - False positives are flagged to reduce similar alerts in the future.

## Should They Be Combined?

### Arguments for Combining:
1. **Unified Architecture**:
   - A single system for both detection and case management could simplify architecture and reduce integration complexity.
2. **Shared Data Models**:
   - Both modules rely on the same underlying data (e.g., transactions, customer profiles, alerts).
3. **Streamlined Workflow**:
   - Combining them could eliminate redundant data transfers and improve performance.
4. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Shared infrastructure and development efforts can reduce overall costs.

### Arguments for Keeping Them Separate:
1. **Specialization**:
   - The Fraud Detection Engine is optimized for analytics and pattern recognition, while the Fraudulent Activity Module focuses on investigation and case management.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Detection workloads (real-time, high volume) differ from investigation workloads (interactive, lower volume). Keeping them separate allows independent scaling.
3. **Regulatory Requirements**:
   - Some regulations may require clear separation between detection and investigative systems to ensure auditability and compliance.
4. **Independent Evolution**:
   - The Fraud Detection Engine may evolve with new algorithms and models, while the Fraudulent Activity Module may focus on enhancing investigator tools.

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Modular but Integrated Design
- Maintain separate modules for detection and investigation, but ensure tight integration through APIs or messaging systems.
- Use shared data models to simplify interactions and ensure consistency.

### 2. Shared Services
- Common components like rule repositories, alert storage, and risk scoring engines can be shared to avoid redundancy.

### 3. Flexible Integration Points
- Allow for seamless integration with other systems like the **Insights Dashboard**, **Case Management System**, and **AML Knowledge Repository**.
