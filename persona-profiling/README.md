# Persona Profiling Module

## Overview

### What is Persona Profiling?
**Persona Profiling** is the process of creating comprehensive profiles for individuals, organizations, or accounts by aggregating and analyzing data from multiple sources. This module builds a 360-degree view of entities using historical transactions, KYC data, behavioral patterns, and risk assessments. Persona profiles are pivotal in identifying anomalies, detecting fraud, and enhancing investigative capabilities.

### Benefits of Persona Profiling in AML
1. **Enhanced Customer Insights**: Consolidate data from multiple systems to understand customer behavior.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Compare current activities against established persona profiles to flag deviations.
3. **Improved Risk Scoring**: Use a holistic view of entities to refine risk assessments and reduce false positives.
4. **Streamlined Investigations**: Provide investigators with a centralized, detailed view of entity activities.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Support evidence-based reporting with detailed persona histories.

## Services Provided

1. **360-Degree Profile Creation**: Aggregate data from multiple sources to create detailed persona profiles.
2. **Real-Time Profile Updates**: Continuously update profiles with new transactional and behavioral data.
3. **Behavioral Persona Analysis**: Analyze and categorize entities based on historical and current behaviors.
4. **Risk Persona Scoring**: Dynamically update risk scores based on evolving persona attributes.
5. **Profile Comparison Tools**: Compare entities against peer groups or predefined benchmarks.
6. **Integration with AML Knowledge Repository**: Leverage rules, typologies, and thresholds to enhance profiling.

## Integration with AML Knowledge Repository

The **Persona Profiling Module** integrates with the **AML Knowledge Repository** to access static rules, typologies, and thresholds. The repository guides persona creation and provides parameters for risk assessments and behavioral benchmarks.

### How It Works
1. **Rule Retrieval**:
   - Access rules for profile creation, such as:
     - "Include all KYC fields and recent transactions."
     - "Flag incomplete profiles for review."
   - Retrieve typologies for profiling entities (e.g., layering, smurfing).

2. **Threshold Configuration**:
   - Retrieve dynamic thresholds, such as:
     - "Low-risk profiles: Transactions < $1,000/month."
     - "High-risk profiles: Linked to high-risk regions or industries."

3. **Behavioral Benchmarks**:
   - Use repository-defined benchmarks to categorize personas (e.g., retail customers, SMEs, large corporations).

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Update the repository with new persona insights and suggested rules for future profiling.

## Detailed Breakdown of Services

### 1. **360-Degree Profile Creation**
   - **Data Aggregation**:
     - Combine KYC details, transactional data, behavioral patterns, and external data (e.g., sanctions lists).
   - **Unified Profiles**:
     - Consolidate data into a single, comprehensive profile for each entity.
   - **Historical Context**:
     - Include historical activity and previous risk assessments.

---

### 2. **Real-Time Profile Updates**
   - **Dynamic Data Integration**:
     - Continuously integrate new transactional and behavioral data into profiles.
   - **Trigger-Based Updates**:
     - Automatically update profiles when significant events occur (e.g., a high-value transaction).
   - **Anomaly Integration**:
     - Add flagged anomalies to profiles for investigator review.

---

### 3. **Behavioral Persona Analysis**
   - **Behavior Categorization**:
     - Group entities based on behavioral patterns (e.g., frequent small transfers, high-value transactions).
   - **Baseline Behavior Establishment**:
     - Define normal behavior for each entity using historical data.
   - **Behavior Shift Detection**:
     - Identify deviations from established behavior baselines.

---

### 4. **Risk Persona Scoring**
   - **Composite Risk Scores**:
     - Calculate scores based on multiple dimensions:
       - KYC details (e.g., age, industry, location).
       - Transactional behavior (e.g., volume, frequency, patterns).
       - External risk factors (e.g., sanctions, PEP status).
   - **Dynamic Scoring Models**:
     - Continuously update scores using new data and repository thresholds.
   - **Risk Categorization**:
     - Classify entities into risk categories (e.g., low, medium, high).

---

### 5. **Profile Comparison Tools**
   - **Peer Group Analysis**:
     - Compare personas to similar entities within the system (e.g., same industry, location).
   - **Benchmarking**:
     - Assess entities against repository-defined benchmarks (e.g., average transaction value for SMEs).
   - **Anomaly Highlighting**:
     - Flag entities significantly deviating from their peers or benchmarks.

---

### 6. **Behavioral Insights and Reporting**
   - **Persona Dashboards**:
     - Display detailed profiles, including risk scores, behavior trends, and flagged anomalies.
   - **Trend Analysis**:
     - Monitor changes in persona attributes over time.
   - **Regulatory Reports**:
     - Generate comprehensive reports for compliance audits and investigations.

## Integration with Other Subsystems

### 1. **Fraud Detection Engine**
   - Shares risk scores and flagged persona attributes for fraud detection.
   - Uses fraud rules from the repository to refine persona-based alerts.

### 2. **Behavioral Analytics Module**
   - Correlates persona profiles with behavioral anomalies for deeper insights.
   - Uses baseline behaviors from persona profiles for anomaly detection.

### 3. **Alert Management System**
   - Generates alerts based on persona risk scores and flagged attributes.
   - Links alerts to detailed profiles for investigator review.

### 4. **Case Management System**
   - Provides investigators with complete persona profiles, including historical data and risk assessments.
   - Links profiles to active cases for context and insights.
