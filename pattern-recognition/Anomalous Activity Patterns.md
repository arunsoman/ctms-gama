### **Anomalous Activity Patterns: Implementation**

#### **1. Unexplained Fund Sources**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Source Validation**:
        - Cross-check transaction inflows with declared income, business revenue, or external funding sources.
     2. **Threshold Analysis**:
        - Flag transactions exceeding a predefined ratio of inflows to declared income or expected revenues.
     3. **Pattern Matching**:
        - Compare inflow patterns against typical funding sources for the account type.
     4. **External Data Integration**:
        - Integrate with tax records, employment data, or corporate financial statements for validation.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction inflows, customer KYC data, external income verification sources.
   - **Example**:
     - A salaried employee receives $500,000 in a single wire transfer without a declared asset sale or loan.

#### **2. High Turnover Rates**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Turnover Calculation**:
        - Compute the rate at which funds flow into and out of an account over a rolling time window.
     2. **Anomaly Detection**:
        - Identify accounts with unusually high turnover relative to their profile or peer group.
     3. **Transaction Type Analysis**:
        - Analyze transaction types (e.g., deposits vs. withdrawals) to confirm turnover intent.
     4. **Risk Score Adjustment**:
        - Assign higher risk scores to accounts with high turnover and minimal retained balances.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Inflow and outflow data, account balance history, customer profile.
   - **Example**:
     - An account receives and withdraws $10 million within a week, retaining only $1,000.

#### **3. Split Transactions**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Transaction Grouping**:
        - Group transactions from the same account or customer within a short time frame.
     2. **Aggregation Analysis**:
        - Calculate the cumulative amount and compare it to predefined thresholds.
     3. **Behavioral Cross-Check**:
        - Evaluate against the customerâ€™s historical transaction patterns and declared activities.
     4. **Flagging Criteria**:
        - Trigger alerts for splits where the total exceeds limits or matches known smurfing typologies.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction timestamps, amounts, account identifiers.
   - **Example**:
     - A customer deposits $9,900 in cash ten times on the same day across different branches.

#### **4. Unusual Payment Methods**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Method Profiling**:
        - Profile typical payment methods (e.g., cash, wire transfer, checks) for each customer or account type.
     2. **Deviation Analysis**:
        - Identify sudden shifts to higher-risk methods, such as cash or crypto payments.
     3. **Cross-Check with Context**:
        - Validate method shifts against changes in customer activity, business needs, or geography.
     4. **Machine Learning Models**:
        - Use classification models to predict risk based on transaction methods.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction methods, customer activity logs, payment method risk scores.
   - **Example**:
     - A corporate account that exclusively uses wire transfers suddenly begins withdrawing large amounts of cash.

#### **5. Unusual Volume and Frequency**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Volume and Frequency Metrics**:
        - Compute metrics for transaction volume and frequency over rolling time windows.
     2. **Behavioral and Peer Comparison**:
        - Compare observed values against historical baselines and peer group norms.
     3. **Anomaly Scoring**:
        - Apply z-scores or machine learning models to highlight significant deviations.
     4. **Threshold-Based Alerts**:
        - Trigger alerts for deviations exceeding pre-configured thresholds.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction logs, customer profiles, historical and peer group data.
   - **Example**:
     - A retail account that averages 50 transactions a week suddenly executes 500 in a single day.

#### **6. Unusual Counterparty Behavior**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Counterparty Profiling**:
        - Profile typical transaction behaviors for each counterparty.
     2. **Transaction Analysis**:
        - Monitor for unexpected behavior, such as counterparty location changes or rapid account shifts.
     3. **Cross-Check with Sanctions/Watchlists**:
        - Flag counterparties linked to high-risk lists or flagged jurisdictions.
     4. **Link Analysis**:
        - Use graph analytics to uncover indirect connections with known suspicious entities.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Counterparty identifiers, transaction logs, risk lists, and geographic data.
   - **Example**:
     - A regular supplier account suddenly redirects payments to an offshore account in a high-risk jurisdiction.

#### **Implementation Techniques Across Anomalous Activity Patterns**

1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Use statistical methods such as z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), or MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) to detect anomalies.

2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Implement models like Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, or k-NN for anomaly detection in high-dimensional data.

3. **Time-Series Analysis**:
   - Apply ARIMA or Seasonal Decomposition models to detect trends, seasonality, and anomalies in transaction patterns.

4. **Graph Analytics**:
   - Use graph databases and algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) for identifying counterparty and transaction relationship anomalies.

5. **Behavioral Baselines**:
   - Continuously update customer behavioral profiles using historical and real-time data.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Use visual tools (e.g., heatmaps, anomaly graphs) to represent and analyze flagged patterns for investigators.
