### **Patterns Detected by the Pattern Recognition Module (AML Context)**

The **Pattern Recognition Module** is a cornerstone of AML systems, capable of identifying a wide variety of patterns indicative of suspicious activities. These patterns are often complex and span multiple dimensions, such as transaction behavior, entity relationships, geographic movements, and temporal anomalies. Below is a comprehensive list of patterns this module can detect:

---

### **1. Transaction-Based Patterns**
   - **Unusual Transaction Sizes**:
     - Transactions just below reporting thresholds (structuring/smurfing).
     - Sudden large deposits or withdrawals.
   - **Frequent Small Transactions**:
     - Numerous small-value transactions aggregating to significant sums.
   - **Round-Number Transactions**:
     - Suspiciously frequent transactions with round figures (e.g., $10,000, $5,000).
   - **Rapid-Fire Transactions**:
     - Multiple transactions occurring within a very short time frame.
   - **Dormant Account Activity**:
     - Large transactions from accounts with little or no prior activity.

---

### **2. Behavioral Patterns**
   - **Significant Behavioral Deviations**:
     - Customerâ€™s activity deviates significantly from their typical behavior or peer group norms.
   - **High-Risk Occupation Indicators**:
     - Transaction patterns associated with high-risk professions (e.g., casinos, real estate).
   - **New Account Risk**:
     - Newly opened accounts showing unusual activity patterns shortly after creation.
   - **Transaction Method Shifts**:
     - Abrupt shifts in transaction methods (e.g., from cash to wire transfers).

---

### **3. Counterparty-Related Patterns**
   - **Frequent Counterparty Transactions**:
     - Repeated transactions with the same counterparties, especially when linked to flagged entities.
   - **Circular Transactions**:
     - Transactions routed through multiple entities that ultimately return to the original account.
   - **Suspicious Cross-Border Counterparties**:
     - Involvement with counterparties in high-risk jurisdictions.
   - **High Concentration of Counterparties**:
     - One account interacting with an unusually high number of counterparties.

---

### **4. Network and Relationship Patterns**
   - **Network Activity**:
     - Transactions involving interconnected accounts or entities forming suspicious networks.
   - **Hidden Connections**:
     - Discovery of indirect relationships between entities via intermediaries.
   - **Layering Techniques**:
     - Patterns indicative of complex layering to obscure the origin of funds.
   - **Third-Party Fund Transfers**:
     - Money routed through unrelated third parties before reaching its final destination.

---

### **5. Temporal Patterns**
   - **Odd-Time Transactions**:
     - Transactions occurring at unusual times (e.g., late-night or non-business hours).
   - **Recurring Transaction Patterns**:
     - Regular transactions at fixed intervals with no clear justification.
   - **Seasonal Activity Shifts**:
     - Sudden spikes or drops in activity during specific periods (e.g., holidays).
   - **Unexplained Frequency Changes**:
     - Accounts or entities significantly increasing or decreasing transaction frequency.

---

### **6. Geospatial Patterns**
   - **Multiple Locations**:
     - Transactions originating from multiple distant locations within short time spans.
   - **High-Risk Geographies**:
     - Activities centered around blacklisted or greylisted regions.
   - **Cross-Border Transfers**:
     - Funds moving rapidly across multiple international borders.

---

### **7. Industry-Specific Patterns**
   - **Real Estate Transactions**:
     - Suspiciously high volumes of real estate purchases.
   - **Cash-Intensive Businesses**:
     - High volumes of cash transactions not aligning with declared business activities.
   - **Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML)**:
     - Use of over/under-invoicing, misclassification of goods, or phantom shipments.

---

### **8. Anomalous Activity Patterns**
   - **Unexplained Fund Sources**:
     - Significant inflows with no identifiable source or justification.
   - **High Turnover Rates**:
     - Rapid cycling of funds into and out of accounts without accumulating balances.
   - **Split Transactions**:
     - A single large transaction split into smaller parts across different accounts.

---

### **9. Entity and Device-Based Patterns**
   - **Shared Device or IP**:
     - Multiple accounts performing transactions from the same device or IP address.
   - **Device Location Mismatches**:
     - Transactions from a device located in a country different from the registered address.

---

### **10. Money Laundering Typology Patterns**
   - **Smurfing**:
     - Structuring large amounts into smaller transactions across multiple accounts.
   - **Hawala or Informal Transfers**:
     - Funds moving through informal value transfer systems with no traditional banking footprint.
   - **Shell Companies**:
     - Patterns indicative of funds being routed through entities with minimal operational activity.
   - **Fake Invoicing**:
     - Patterns of transactions involving over/under-valued invoices for goods or services.
   - **Charity Fraud**:
     - Donations or transactions involving charitable organizations with unusual activity levels.

---

### **11. High-Risk Account Patterns**
   - **Dormant Accounts Becoming Active**:
     - Sudden high-value activity in long-dormant accounts.
   - **Multiple Accounts**:
     - One individual controlling multiple accounts with coordinated activity.
   - **Account Ownership Changes**:
     - Transfers of account ownership followed by suspicious activity.

---

### **12. Group and Cluster Activity Patterns**
   - **Collaborative Laundering**:
     - Groups of individuals or entities collaborating to structure funds across accounts.
   - **Family or Associate Networks**:
     - Patterns showing coordinated activities within familial or associate groups.
   - **Cluster Transactions**:
     - Multiple small transactions involving a tight-knit group.

---

### **13. High-Value Patterns**
   - **Luxury Purchases**:
     - Payments for high-value items (e.g., art, cars) with no discernible income sources.
   - **Cryptocurrency Transfers**:
     - Patterns involving rapid or large-scale movement of funds into/out of cryptocurrency.

These patterns form the foundation for the **Pattern Recognition Module**, leveraging rule-based logic, machine learning, and statistical methods to detect suspicious activities. Let me know if you'd like to expand further on how these patterns are implemented, scored, or visualized!
