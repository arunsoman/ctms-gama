### **Entity and Device-Based Patterns: Implementation**

#### **1. Shared Device or IP**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Device/IP Mapping**:
        - Map transactions to unique device identifiers (e.g., MAC address) or IP addresses.
     2. **Cross-Account Analysis**:
        - Identify cases where multiple accounts use the same device or IP for transactions.
     3. **Threshold-Based Alerts**:
        - Flag devices or IPs linked to an unusually high number of accounts or transactions.
     4. **Risk Scoring**:
        - Assign higher risk scores to devices/IPs located in high-risk regions or associated with flagged entities.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Device IDs, IP addresses, transaction metadata.
   - **Example**:
     - Ten unrelated accounts use the same IP address to initiate high-value transactions within an hour.

#### **2. Device Location Mismatches**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Geolocation Extraction**:
        - Extract device location (e.g., GPS data) during transactions.
     2. **Address Validation**:
        - Cross-check the device location against the customer’s registered address or usual activity zones.
     3. **Movement Feasibility Analysis**:
        - Evaluate location changes based on time gaps to detect improbable movements.
     4. **Anomaly Detection**:
        - Flag accounts showing repeated mismatches between registered and actual device locations.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Device geolocation, registered addresses, transaction timestamps.
   - **Example**:
     - A customer’s account, registered in New York, is accessed from Singapore within minutes of a local transaction.

#### **3. Device or IP Reuse Across Entities**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Entity Mapping**:
        - Map devices and IPs to all associated accounts and counterparties.
     2. **Repetition Thresholds**:
        - Define thresholds for the number of accounts or transactions linked to the same device/IP.
     3. **Behavioral Analysis**:
        - Compare reuse patterns against typical customer or organizational behaviors.
     4. **Alert Generation**:
        - Flag devices or IPs linked to multiple suspicious or unrelated accounts.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Device and IP logs, account relationships, transaction details.
   - **Example**:
     - A single device is used to access 50 different accounts in a week, all with high-value transactions.

#### **4. Blacklisted Device or IP Usage**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Blacklist Integration**:
        - Maintain a blacklist of flagged devices and IPs (e.g., from previous investigations or external threat intelligence).
     2. **Transaction Monitoring**:
        - Continuously monitor transactions for device/IP matches with the blacklist.
     3. **Risk Score Assignment**:
        - Assign higher risk scores to accounts and transactions involving blacklisted devices/IPs.
     4. **Escalation Workflow**:
        - Automatically escalate flagged transactions for immediate investigation.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Blacklist data, transaction logs, device and IP identifiers.
   - **Example**:
     - A flagged IP address is used to initiate a $500,000 transaction from a new account.

#### **5. Unusual Device or IP Activity**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Baseline Profiling**:
        - Establish baseline usage patterns for devices and IPs (e.g., typical transaction frequency, time of access).
     2. **Anomaly Detection**:
        - Identify deviations such as unusual transaction volumes or off-hours activity.
     3. **Location-Based Context Analysis**:
        - Cross-check unusual activity with device/IP geolocation data.
     4. **Threshold-Based Alerts**:
        - Trigger alerts for activity exceeding predefined limits or inconsistent with the baseline.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Device/IP metadata, transaction logs, behavioral baselines.
   - **Example**:
     - A device used exclusively during business hours initiates multiple transactions at midnight.

#### **6. Account Hopping**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Device-Account Correlation**:
        - Monitor for devices accessing multiple accounts over a short time period.
     2. **Transaction Pattern Analysis**:
        - Analyze transactions to identify patterns of account hopping (e.g., rapid fund transfers across accounts).
     3. **Graph-Based Relationships**:
        - Build a graph of account-device relationships to identify potential money-laundering networks.
     4. **Risk Score Assignment**:
        - Assign higher risk scores to accounts involved in hopping patterns.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Device logs, account identifiers, transaction timestamps.
   - **Example**:
     - A device accesses five accounts in sequence, transferring funds between them within minutes.

#### **Implementation Techniques Across Entity and Device-Based Patterns**

1. **Graph Analytics**:
   - Use graph databases (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB) to model relationships between devices, accounts, and transactions for anomaly detection.

2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Train models to detect device or IP anomalies using features like usage frequency, geolocation changes, and linked account diversity.

3. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Leverage geospatial databases and tools to evaluate location-based inconsistencies or suspicious device usage.

4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
   - Regularly update blacklists with data from threat intelligence feeds or past investigations.

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Use real-time analytics pipelines (e.g., Kafka, Flink) to flag unusual device or IP behavior as it occurs.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Use heatmaps, device-relationship graphs, and location overlays to provide investigators with clear insights.
