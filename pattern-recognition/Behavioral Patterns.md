### **Behavioral Patterns: Implementation**

#### **1. Significant Behavioral Deviations**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Baseline Behavior Profiling**:
        - Create a baseline profile for each customer using historical transaction data (e.g., average transaction size, frequency, transaction types).
     2. **Deviation Detection**:
        - Use statistical methods like standard deviation and z-scores to identify transactions that deviate significantly from the baseline.
     3. **Peer Group Comparison**:
        - Compare individual behavior with similar customers (e.g., same occupation, income level, geographic location).
     4. **Machine Learning Models**:
        - Implement anomaly detection models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to highlight unusual behavior.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Historical transaction logs, customer profiles, peer group data.
   - **Example**:
     - A customer typically transacts $1,000/month but suddenly makes multiple $20,000 transfers in a week.

#### **2. High-Risk Occupation Indicators**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Occupation Risk Scoring**:
        - Assign risk scores to occupations based on industry AML typologies (e.g., cash-intensive businesses, legal professions).
     2. **Pattern Matching**:
        - Match transactions against known high-risk occupation patterns (e.g., frequent cash deposits for a casino owner).
     3. **Risk Weight Aggregation**:
        - Aggregate occupation-based risk scores with other risk factors (e.g., location, transaction type).
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Customer occupation data, industry-specific risk profiles, transaction logs.
   - **Example**:
     - A real estate broker involved in multiple high-value cash transactions without supporting documentation.

#### **3. New Account Risk**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **New Account Tagging**:
        - Identify and tag accounts as "new" based on the account opening date (e.g., <90 days old).
     2. **Transaction Pattern Monitoring**:
        - Monitor for high-value transactions or unusual activity spikes soon after account creation.
     3. **Behavioral Comparison**:
        - Compare transaction patterns with other new accounts of similar profiles.
     4. **Anomaly Scoring**:
        - Assign higher risk scores to accounts showing anomalous activity relative to other new accounts.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Account opening date, transaction logs, peer group activity data.
   - **Example**:
     - A new account receives a $100,000 wire transfer within days of creation, with no additional activity.

#### **4. Transaction Method Shifts**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Method Profiling**:
        - Profile preferred transaction methods (e.g., cash deposits, wire transfers) for each customer.
     2. **Shift Detection**:
        - Detect abrupt changes in methods (e.g., shifting from cash to wire transfers).
     3. **Cross-Check with Context**:
        - Validate against contextual factors like geographic location changes or new account types.
     4. **Machine Learning Models**:
        - Use classification models to flag unexpected transaction methods for specific profiles.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Historical transaction methods, customer demographics, geographic data.
   - **Example**:
     - A customer previously conducting only cash transactions starts wiring large amounts internationally.

#### **Implementation Techniques Across Behavioral Patterns**

1. **Data Normalization**:
   - Ensure all data points are standardized to handle variations in transaction formats and customer attributes.

2. **Historical Data Analysis**:
   - Aggregate and analyze multi-year transaction histories to establish baselines and trends.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group customers and detect outliers in behavior.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Generate features like transaction volatility, average transaction size, and transaction diversity index for deeper analysis.

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time systems (e.g., Kafka, Flink) to identify deviations as transactions occur.

6. **Alert Thresholds**:
   - Apply configurable thresholds to flag deviations for investigator review, reducing false positives.
