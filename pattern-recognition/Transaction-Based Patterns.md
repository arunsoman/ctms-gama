Let's start with the **Transaction-Based Patterns** section, documenting how each pattern is implemented comprehensively.

### **Transaction-Based Patterns: Implementation**

#### **1. Unusual Transaction Sizes**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Threshold Configuration**:
        - Define thresholds for unusual amounts based on jurisdictional reporting requirements (e.g., $10,000).
     2. **Pattern Rule Definition**:
        - Flag transactions close to, but not exceeding, these thresholds (e.g., $9,999 for $10,000 reporting).
     3. **Statistical Analysis**:
        - Compare transaction sizes against customer and peer group averages.
     4. **Anomaly Detection Models**:
        - Use machine learning to detect deviations in transaction amounts over time.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction amount, account type, customer profile, peer group data.
   - **Example**:
     - A customer consistently deposits $9,900 every week; the system flags these deposits as potential structuring.

#### **2. Frequent Small Transactions**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Transaction Grouping**:
        - Aggregate small transactions by customer within a rolling time window (e.g., daily, weekly).
     2. **Threshold Evaluation**:
        - Check if the aggregated amount exceeds a defined threshold.
     3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
        - Use clustering to identify repeated patterns of small-value transactions.
     4. **Behavioral Comparison**:
        - Compare with normal transaction frequencies for the account or peer group.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction timestamps, amounts, account identifiers.
   - **Example**:
     - A customer conducts 50 transfers of $200 each in one day, triggering aggregation logic and flagging.

#### **3. Round-Number Transactions**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Rule-Based Detection**:
        - Define rules to identify transactions with round numbers (e.g., multiples of $1,000).
     2. **Frequency Analysis**:
        - Evaluate the frequency of such transactions per customer or account.
     3. **Context Evaluation**:
        - Cross-check with the type of transaction (e.g., salary payments, business payments) to exclude legitimate cases.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction amounts, transaction types, customer profiles.
   - **Example**:
     - An individual deposits $10,000, $5,000, and $3,000 consecutively without supporting income documentation.

#### **4. Rapid-Fire Transactions**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Time Window Definition**:
        - Define short time windows (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes) for analyzing transaction bursts.
     2. **Transaction Frequency Monitoring**:
        - Count the number of transactions per account or customer within the defined time window.
     3. **Velocity Analysis**:
        - Use velocity metrics to identify rapid transaction spikes relative to historical patterns.
     4. **Anomaly Detection Models**:
        - Employ ML models to highlight accounts with repeated rapid bursts of activity.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Transaction timestamps, customer/account ID, historical velocity patterns.
   - **Example**:
     - An account executes 20 transactions in 2 minutes, with each transfer going to different accounts.

#### **5. Dormant Account Activity**
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. **Dormancy Criteria**:
        - Define dormancy (e.g., no activity for 6 months).
     2. **Trigger Detection**:
        - Monitor for significant transactions in dormant accounts.
     3. **Behavioral Comparison**:
        - Evaluate transaction patterns post-activation compared to typical account behavior.
     4. **Cross-Check with KYC Data**:
        - Ensure no recent updates to account ownership or status that explain the activity.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - Account activity history, transaction logs, KYC records.
   - **Example**:
     - A dormant account suddenly receives a $50,000 deposit, triggering an alert for review.

#### **Implementation Techniques Across Patterns**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and normalize transaction data for consistent analysis.
   - Include derived fields (e.g., transaction size bands, activity rates).

2. **Rule Engines**:
   - Define and execute transaction rules using flexible rule engines like Drools.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Use supervised learning for threshold predictions (trained on historical suspicious activity).
   - Employ unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering) to discover novel patterns.

4. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Utilize streaming platforms (e.g., Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming) for detecting patterns in real-time.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Display flagged transactions and related details in dashboards for investigators.
   - Provide drill-down reports highlighting all linked activities.
