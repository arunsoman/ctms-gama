# Temporal Analysis Module

## Overview

### What is Temporal Analysis?
**Temporal Analysis** focuses on examining time-based patterns and trends in transactional data to detect anomalies, suspicious behaviors, and time-sensitive money laundering typologies. By analyzing the timing, frequency, and temporal sequences of transactions, this module identifies irregular activities that might not be evident from a static view of the data.

### Benefits of Temporal Analysis in AML
1. **Detect Time-Based Anomalies**: Identify unusual transaction patterns, such as frequent transactions during odd hours or high transaction volumes in short periods.
2. **Spot Structuring Patterns**: Recognize attempts to avoid detection by breaking transactions into smaller amounts over time.
3. **Strengthen Fraud Detection**: Uncover suspicious activities tied to specific temporal behaviors (e.g., end-of-month spikes).
4. **Improve Risk Scoring**: Add a temporal dimension to risk evaluation by correlating suspicious timing with other risk factors.
5. **Support Regulatory Compliance**: Provide evidence-based temporal insights for audits and regulatory reports.

## Services Provided

1. **Time-Based Anomaly Detection**: Identify deviations from typical transaction times and frequencies.
2. **Transaction Sequencing Analysis**: Detect suspicious sequences of transactions over defined time windows.
3. **Odd-Hour Transaction Alerts**: Flag transactions occurring outside normal business hours.
4. **High-Frequency Transaction Detection**: Spot bursts of activity within short timeframes.
5. **Trend Analysis and Reporting**: Analyze temporal trends and generate comprehensive reports.
6. **Integration with AML Knowledge Repository**: Leverage static rules, typologies, and thresholds for temporal anomaly detection.

## Integration with AML Knowledge Repository

The **Temporal Analysis Module** relies on the **AML Knowledge Repository** to access static rules, typologies, and time-based thresholds. The repository acts as the central store for defining and updating detection logic related to timing anomalies.

### How It Works
1. **Rule Retrieval**:
   - Access predefined rules such as:
     - "Flag transactions exceeding three occurrences within one hour."
     - "Highlight transactions over $5,000 occurring outside business hours."
   - Retrieve time-sensitive typologies like:
     - Burst transactions (multiple high-value transactions in a short period).
     - Round-the-clock activity (24-hour spikes).

2. **Threshold Configuration**:
   - Retrieve dynamic thresholds, such as:
     - "Normal business hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM."
     - "Maximum transactions allowed per hour: 5."

3. **Scenario Updates**:
   - Feed new temporal scenarios into the repository for rule refinement.
   - Example: Add a new rule to flag "end-of-quarter transaction spikes."

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Share detected patterns and validated anomalies with the repository to improve rules and typologies.

## Detailed Breakdown of Services

### 1. **Time-Based Anomaly Detection**
   - **Baseline Pattern Establishment**:
     - Use historical data to define normal transaction times and frequencies.
   - **Deviation Detection**:
     - Identify anomalies based on repository-configured thresholds.
     - Examples:
       - Transactions outside business hours.
       - Unusual delays between dependent transactions.

---

### 2. **Transaction Sequencing Analysis**
   - **Sequence Detection**:
     - Analyze the order and timing of related transactions (e.g., deposits followed by immediate withdrawals).
   - **Recursive Activity Tracking**:
     - Detect repetitive sequences over time (e.g., daily transfers of similar amounts).
   - **Dynamic Windowing**:
     - Use configurable time windows from the repository (e.g., "Analyze sequences within 24-hour periods").

---

### 3. **Odd-Hour Transaction Alerts**
   - **Off-Hour Activity Detection**:
     - Flag transactions occurring outside normal operating hours (e.g., 2:00 AM).
   - **Dynamic Thresholds**:
     - Retrieve acceptable hours and time zones from the repository.
   - **Risk Escalation**:
     - Increase risk scores for transactions linked to high-risk time periods.

---

### 4. **High-Frequency Transaction Detection**
   - **Burst Analysis**:
     - Identify multiple transactions within short timeframes (e.g., 10 transactions in 5 minutes).
   - **Cluster Evaluation**:
     - Group transactions into bursts and assess their risk using repository-defined rules.
   - **Threshold Adaptation**:
     - Dynamically adjust thresholds for detecting bursts based on activity patterns.

---

### 5. **Trend Analysis and Reporting**
   - **Temporal Trend Insights**:
     - Analyze trends over configurable timeframes (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
   - **Seasonality Analysis**:
     - Detect recurring temporal patterns, such as end-of-month or holiday spikes.
   - **Comprehensive Reports**:
     - Generate detailed reports showing temporal anomalies and trends for investigators and regulators.

---

### 6. **Advanced Temporal Models**
   - **Machine Learning Integration**:
     - Train models to detect temporal anomalies beyond static thresholds.
   - **Sequence Prediction**:
     - Use predictive models to anticipate suspicious transaction timings.
   - **Dynamic Threshold Learning**:
     - Adjust thresholds over time using machine learning algorithms.
