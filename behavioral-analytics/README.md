# Behavioral Analytics Module

## Overview
The **Behavioral Analytics Module** focuses on analyzing customer behavior by leveraging historical and real-time transactional data. It identifies anomalies, behavioral deviations, and suspicious activities to flag potential money laundering and fraudulent patterns. 

This module integrates deeply with the **AML Knowledge Repository** to access and update static rules, typologies, and thresholds. By using the repository as a central store, the module ensures consistency in rule application across all components and dynamically adapts to new AML scenarios.

## Services Provided

1. **Customer Behavior Monitoring**: Track customer activities and identify shifts in transaction behavior.
2. **Peer Group Analysis**: Compare customer behavior to similar profiles within the system.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze changes in transaction frequency, value, and type over time.
4. **Suspicious Behavior Alerts**: Trigger alerts when behavior deviates significantly from norms.
5. **Scenario Simulation**: Model and test behavior-based detection scenarios for accuracy and effectiveness.
6. **Behavior-Based Risk Scoring**: Dynamically score customer behavior based on detected anomalies.
7. **Behavioral Visualization Tools**: Provide graphical insights into customer and group behavior.
8. **Integration with AML Knowledge Services**: Leverage rules, typologies, and thresholds from the AML Knowledge Repository.

## Integration with AML Knowledge Repository

### How It Works
1. **Rule Retrieval**:
   - The module queries the **AML Knowledge Repository** for static rules and thresholds relevant to behavioral analysis.
   - Examples of rules:
     - "Flag transactions exceeding $10,000."
     - "Trigger an alert for more than three high-value transactions within 24 hours."

2. **Typology Utilization**:
   - The repository provides behavioral typologies, such as:
     - Structuring (smurfing).
     - Layering (disguising origins of funds through complex patterns).
   - These typologies guide the detection of behavior that matches known laundering strategies.

3. **Risk Parameter Configuration**:
   - The repository supplies dynamic parameters, such as:
     - Risk scoring weights for anomalies.
     - Thresholds for flagging behavioral deviations.
   - Example: "Set the threshold for high-risk behavioral anomalies to 85 out of 100."

4. **Rule Updates**:
   - Behavioral insights (e.g., newly identified anomaly patterns) are fed back into the repository.
   - Example: "Add a new rule to flag customers whose transaction frequency doubles within a week."

5. **Scenario Simulation**:
   - The repository provides baseline scenarios and historical case studies for testing new rules.
   - Example: Replay a previous fraud case with modified thresholds to assess detection effectiveness.

## Detailed Breakdown of Services

### 1. **Customer Behavior Monitoring**
   - **Transaction Pattern Analysis**:
     - Track frequent transaction types and values.
     - Identify outliers compared to historical norms.
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**:
     - Correlate real-time transactions with historical profiles.
   - **Baseline Profiles**:
     - Establish and update customer profiles using repository-supplied rules and thresholds.

---

### 2. **Peer Group Analysis**
   - **Group Segmentation**:
     - Segment customers into peer groups using repository-configured rules (e.g., income levels, industries).
   - **Behavioral Comparison**:
     - Compare customersâ€™ activities to peer group norms and flag significant deviations.

---

### 3. **Trend Analysis**
   - **Temporal Behavior Tracking**:
     - Monitor trends over configurable periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
   - **Trend-Based Rules**:
     - Use repository thresholds to flag anomalies (e.g., "Transaction values doubled in a week").

---

### 4. **Suspicious Behavior Alerts**
   - **Rule-Driven Alerts**:
     - Trigger alerts based on repository-defined rules (e.g., "Repeated small transactions to high-risk regions").
   - **Multi-Event Correlation**:
     - Combine behavioral anomalies with other flagged activities for comprehensive alerts.

---

### 5. **Scenario Simulation**
   - **Behavioral Testing**:
     - Test new behavioral scenarios provided by the repository.
   - **Historical Replay**:
     - Analyze historical anomalies against updated repository rules for validation.

---

### 6. **Behavior-Based Risk Scoring**
   - **Dynamic Scoring**:
     - Update risk scores based on real-time behaviors and repository-provided weights.
   - **Composite Scoring**:
     - Combine behavioral insights with other risk dimensions (e.g., geolocation, transaction patterns).

---

### 7. **Behavioral Visualization Tools**
   - **Heatmaps**:
     - Visualize transaction volume across regions or time.
   - **Timeline Graphs**:
     - Display behavioral trends and anomalies chronologically.

---

### 8. **Behavioral Insights Reporting**
   - **Customer-Specific Reports**:
     - Generate detailed behavioral reports using repository-supplied thresholds.
   - **Peer Group Reports**:
     - Aggregate and compare trends within peer groups.
