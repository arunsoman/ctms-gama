# AML Knowledge Repository Module

## Overview
The **AML Knowledge Repository Module** is the central storage for all static rules, typologies, and risk parameters that drive the AML systemâ€™s detection and analysis capabilities. It provides the foundational knowledge for detecting, investigating, and preventing money laundering and fraudulent activities. 

This module is dynamically configurable and ensures consistency across all analytical components by serving as the **single source of truth** for static rules and typologies. It allows seamless updates to rules and parameters without requiring downtime and integrates with all components that rely on AML logic.

## Scope of Work

### 1. Centralized Rule Management
- **Objective**: Maintain a comprehensive repository of AML detection rules.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Store predefined detection rules, such as:
    - High-value transaction detection.
    - Repeated small transactions (smurfing).
    - Circular fund transfers.
  - Enable rule version control to track changes and support rollback.
  - Allow dynamic rule creation, updates, and deletions via an admin interface.
  - Include a testing environment to validate rules before deployment.

---

### 2. Typology Repository
- **Objective**: Store money laundering typologies to assist in scenario-based detection and investigation.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Maintain a categorized library of typologies, such as:
    - Layering.
    - Structuring.
    - Trade-based money laundering.
  - Link typologies to detection rules for contextual understanding.
  - Update typologies dynamically based on regulatory changes or emerging patterns.

---

### 3. Risk Parameter Library
- **Objective**: Provide configurable parameters to evaluate risk dynamically.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Store thresholds for risk evaluation, such as:
    - Transaction amount limits.
    - Risk scoring weights.
    - Geographical risk levels.
  - Allow parameter updates without disrupting live systems.
  - Validate parameter changes to avoid misconfiguration.

### 4. Integration with Analytical Components
The **AML Knowledge Repository** acts as a central hub for rules and static configurations used across analytical modules. It ensures uniformity in rule application and allows analytical components to update the repository with validated insights.

#### **Integration Details**:
1. **Temporal Analysis Engine**:
   - Retrieves rules for time-based anomalies (e.g., high-value transactions during odd hours).
   - Updates the repository with new thresholds for time-based risk factors (e.g., "Flag transactions exceeding $5,000 outside working hours").

2. **Behavioral Analytics Module**:
   - Accesses customer typologies and rules for normal behavior patterns.
   - Stores static customer behavioral profiles (e.g., "Customer typically transacts <$1,000/month") as benchmarks.
   - Updates the repository with detected behavior shifts that may require new rules.

3. **Network Analysis Module**:
   - Uses rules to detect circular fund transfers, high-risk connections, and hidden relationships.
   - Adds static network patterns (e.g., "High-volume transfers between two nodes") to the repository for future reference.

4. **Fraud Detection Engine**:
   - Continuously queries active rules for real-time fraud detection.
   - Updates the repository with detection insights that refine existing rules.

5. **Alert Management System**:
   - Links alerts to specific rules for investigator insights.
   - Retrieves descriptions and metadata for rules linked to each alert.

6. **Case Management System**:
   - Provides investigators with rule-based explanations of flagged cases.
   - Stores investigator-suggested rule modifications for review.

### 5. Knowledge Base for Investigators
- **Objective**: Support investigators with context, guidance, and historical data.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Provide a searchable library of AML rules, typologies, and case studies.
  - Include regulatory guidelines and best practices.
  - Link rules to historical cases for context (e.g., "This rule flagged 30 cases last month").

---

### 6. Monitoring and Auditing
- **Objective**: Ensure repository reliability and compliance.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Log all changes to rules, typologies, and risk parameters.
  - Generate audit reports detailing repository updates and their impact.
  - Monitor repository usage by analytical components and administrators.

---

## Developer Requirements

### Key Components
1. **Rule and Typology Management**:
   - Create a modular architecture for managing rules and typologies.
   - Include APIs for querying and updating rules dynamically.

2. **Risk Parameter Configuration**:
   - Develop tools to manage thresholds and parameters, with built-in validation.

3. **Integration APIs**:
   - Secure endpoints for other components to query, retrieve, and update repository data.

## Example Workflow

1. **Adding a New Typology**:
   - Input:
     ```json
     {
         "typologyId": "TYP001",
         "name": "Layering",
         "description": "Moving funds through multiple accounts to obscure their origin.",
         "linkedRules": ["R001", "R002"]
     }
     ```
   - Output:
     - Typology added to the repository and linked to relevant rules.

2. **Retrieving Rules for Temporal Analysis**:
   - Input:
     ```http
     GET /api/rules?type=temporal
     Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
     ```
   - Output:
     ```json
     [
         {
             "ruleId": "R005",
             "name": "Odd-Hour Transactions",
             "conditions": [
                 {"field": "timestamp", "operator": "outside", "value": "09:00-18:00"}
             ],
             "riskScore": 30
         }
     ]
     ```

3. **Updating a Risk Parameter**:
   - Input:
     ```json
     {
         "parameter": "highValueThreshold",
         "newValue": 20000
     }
     ```
   - Output:
     - Repository updated with the new threshold.
