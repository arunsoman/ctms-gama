# Link Analysis Module

## Overview

### What is Link Analysis?
**Link Analysis** is a technique used to identify relationships and connections between entities, such as individuals, accounts, or transactions. In the context of AML, it is crucial for uncovering hidden networks, detecting circular fund transfers, and identifying relationships between high-risk entities.

### Benefits of Link Analysis in AML
1. **Uncover Hidden Networks**: Detect indirect relationships between entities involved in suspicious activities.
2. **Identify Money Laundering Patterns**: Recognize typologies like circular transfers, layering, and trade-based laundering.
3. **Visualize Complex Relationships**: Provide intuitive visualizations of connections for investigators.
4. **Enhance Fraud Detection**: Strengthen alerts and case investigations by providing contextual insights.
5. **Improve Regulatory Reporting**: Support evidence-based reporting to regulators with detailed relationship maps.

## Services Provided

1. **Relationship Mapping**: Identify direct and indirect relationships between entities.
2. **Network Visualization**: Provide visual representations of entity connections.
3. **Circular Transfer Detection**: Detect patterns of circular transactions and fund flows.
4. **Cluster Analysis**: Identify clusters of interconnected entities with shared risk factors.
5. **High-Risk Connection Identification**: Highlight links to entities on watchlists or sanctions lists.
6. **Integration with AML Knowledge Repository**: Utilize static rules and typologies for detecting and analyzing relationships.

## Integration with AML Knowledge Repository

The **Link Analysis Module** relies on the **AML Knowledge Repository** for static rules, typologies, and thresholds to guide its analysis. The repository serves as the central store for detection rules and typologies related to network analysis.

### How It Works
1. **Rule Retrieval**:
   - Access relationship-based rules, such as:
     - "Flag circular fund transfers involving three or more accounts."
     - "Highlight connections with entities on sanctions lists."
   - Use typologies to define patterns for network risks (e.g., layering, structuring).

2. **Dynamic Thresholds**:
   - Retrieve thresholds for network analysis, such as:
     - "Maximum number of hops allowed between entities before flagging."
     - "Risk score increase for links to politically exposed persons (PEPs)."

3. **Network Typologies**:
   - Leverage typologies to identify specific network patterns, such as:
     - Frequent transactions between a closed group of accounts.
     - Funds moving between high-risk regions.

4. **Updates to Repository**:
   - Feed newly identified network patterns into the repository for rule refinement.
   - Example: Add a new rule for "Repeated transactions between unconnected entities within 24 hours."

## Detailed Breakdown of Services

### 1. **Relationship Mapping**
   - **Direct Relationship Identification**:
     - Map transactions between source and destination accounts.
   - **Indirect Relationship Discovery**:
     - Identify connections across multiple hops (e.g., Account A → Account B → Account C).
   - **Visualization**:
     - Generate relationship graphs showing links and transaction details.

---

### 2. **Network Visualization**
   - **Graphical Representation**:
     - Display entity connections using interactive graphs.
   - **Highlight Risky Links**:
     - Emphasize high-risk connections (e.g., links to sanctioned entities or PEPs).
   - **Dynamic Filtering**:
     - Allow investigators to filter connections by attributes (e.g., transaction value, location).

---

### 3. **Circular Transfer Detection**
   - **Transaction Loop Identification**:
     - Detect circular fund flows where money moves back to its origin.
   - **Complex Pattern Recognition**:
     - Identify multi-hop loops involving multiple entities.
   - **Threshold-Based Analysis**:
     - Use repository-configured thresholds (e.g., "Flag loops above $10,000 in value").

---

### 4. **Cluster Analysis**
   - **Entity Clustering**:
     - Group accounts and entities based on transaction volume, frequency, and shared connections.
   - **Shared Risk Factors**:
     - Identify clusters with common high-risk attributes (e.g., linked to the same geography or business sector).
   - **Anomaly Detection**:
     - Highlight unusual activity within clusters (e.g., one entity performing significantly more transactions).

---

### 5. **High-Risk Connection Identification**
   - **Sanctions and Watchlist Integration**:
     - Flag connections to entities appearing on sanctions lists, watchlists, or adverse media.
   - **PEP Linkage Detection**:
     - Detect direct or indirect relationships with politically exposed persons.
   - **Risk Scoring**:
     - Increase risk scores for accounts based on their proximity to high-risk entities.

---

### 6. **Behavioral Link Insights**
   - Combine behavioral analytics with network data to:
     - Correlate suspicious transactions with known high-risk connections.
     - Detect shifts in relationship patterns, such as the emergence of new intermediaries.
