# Data Normalization and Validation Module

## Overview
The **Data Normalization and Validation Module** is responsible for ensuring that data ingested from Financial Institutions (FIs) adheres to required standards. This module prepares the data for downstream processing by validating its integrity, completeness, and structure, while standardizing it into a unified format. It also ensures that data meets predefined schemas and quality standards, providing detailed feedback for errors or inconsistencies.

---

## Scope of Work

### 1. Schema Enforcement
- **Objective**: Ensure that incoming data adheres to a predefined schema.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Define schemas for customer information, transaction details, and other data types.
  - Validate incoming data against these schemas.
  - Reject data that fails validation and generate error logs.

---

### 2. Data Normalization
- **Objective**: Convert diverse data formats and structures into a unified format defined by the internal data models.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Standardize field names, data types, and date-time formats (e.g., ISO 8601).
  - Normalize customer details, such as names (e.g., removing extra spaces) and addresses.
  - Convert monetary values into a standard currency format with consistent precision (e.g., 2 decimal places).
  - Normalize geolocation data to `latitude` and `longitude` fields.
  - Handle missing optional fields by inserting defaults or null values.

---

### 3. Mandatory Field Validation
- **Objective**: Ensure that required fields are present and correctly populated.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Validate that mandatory fields (e.g., `customerId`, `transactionId`) are not null or empty.
  - Check for correct field formats (e.g., valid email addresses, phone numbers).
  - Flag incomplete or partially populated records for further review.

---

### 4. Duplicate Detection and Removal
- **Objective**: Identify and remove duplicate records from the dataset.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Implement hash-based deduplication to detect identical records.
  - Apply fuzzy matching to identify near-duplicate records.
  - Maintain logs of deduplication actions for audit purposes.

---

### 5. Data Quality Checks
- **Objective**: Assess and improve the quality of ingested data.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Implement checks for data accuracy, consistency, and relevancy.
  - Generate quality metrics reports (e.g., percentage of valid records).
  - Provide feedback to FIs about common data quality issues.

---

### 6. Error Reporting and Feedback
- **Objective**: Provide actionable feedback on validation failures.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Create detailed error reports for each rejected record.
  - Notify data providers (FIs) about common issues in their submissions.
  - Enable real-time notifications for high failure rates.
  - Categorize errors:
    - **Critical**: Block data ingestion (e.g., missing `customerId`).
    - **Warning**: Flag for review but allow ingestion (e.g., missing optional `email`).

---

### 7. Enrichment for Downstream Systems
- **Objective**: Enhance data quality to facilitate efficient use in analytics and detection systems.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Add derived fields (e.g., `riskCategory` based on `riskScore` thresholds).
  - Normalize country names to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes.
  - Enrich data with FI metadata (e.g., FI ID, ingestion timestamp).

---

## Integration with Other Modules

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Input**: Raw data from FIs in JSON, XML, or CSV format.
- **Process**:
  - Extract and validate API keys for tracking (via FI Onboarding Module).
  - Process incoming data batches or streams for normalization and validation.
- **Output**: Normalized, validated data to downstream modules.

### 2. Customer Information Repository
- **Input**: Normalized customer data (`Customer` model).
- **Process**:
  - Validate completeness of customer profiles.
  - Ensure deduplication by checking `customerId` uniqueness.

### 3. Transaction Repository
- **Input**: Normalized transaction data (`Transaction` model).
- **Process**:
  - Ensure all transaction fields meet validation rules.
  - Aggregate metadata for summary reporting.

---

## Developer Requirements

### Key Components
1. **Normalization Engine**:
   - Build a flexible engine to map FI-specific field names and structures to the system's internal models.
   - Include support for dynamic mappings (e.g., configurable rules per FI).

2. **Validation Framework**:
   - Implement a rules engine to validate schema, data types, and business rules.
   - Use libraries or frameworks that support schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema, XML Schema).

3. **Error Management System**:
   - Create error-handling workflows to categorize, log, and escalate issues.
   - Develop APIs or dashboards for FIs to retrieve error reports.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack) to track validation failures.

---

## Technology Recommendations
- **Programming Language**: Java, Python, or Node.js.
- **Validation Frameworks**: JSON Schema, Apache Avro, or custom validators.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for staging validated data.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Log aggregation tools like ELK Stack to track validation failures.

---

## Deliverables
1. **Normalized Data Output**:
   - All data conforms to the internal models (`Customer`, `Transaction`, etc.).
2. **Validation Reports**:
   - Detailed logs of validation errors with categorizations.
3. **Extensibility**:
   - Support for adding new normalization rules dynamically.
4. **Error Reporting Mechanisms**:
   - APIs and dashboards for error reports.
5. **Documentation**:
   - Configuration files defining schemas and validation rules.
   - Validation workflows and error codes.

## Example Workflow

1. **Input Data** (from FI):
   ```json
   {
       "customer_id": "12345",
       "first_name": "John",
       "last_name": "Doe",
       "date_of_birth": "1985-05-12",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
       "transactions": [
           {
               "transaction_id": "T123",
               "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
               "amount": "100.50",
               "currency": "USD",
               "type": "Credit",
               "source_account": "9876543210",
               "destination_account": "1234567890"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

2. **Normalized Output**:
   ```json
   {

       "firstName": "John",
       "lastName": "Doe",
       "dateOfBirth": "1985-05-12",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
       "transactions": [
           {
               "transactionId": "T123",
               "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z",
               "amount": 100.50,
               "currency": "USD",
               "transactionType": "Credit",
               "sourceAccountId": "9876543210",
               "destinationAccountId": "1234567890"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Validation Error Example**:
   ```json
   {
       "errors": [
           {
               "field": "email",
               "message": "Invalid email format",
               "severity": "warning"
           },
           {
               "field": "transaction.amount",
               "message": "Amount must be greater than zero",
               "severity": "critical"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
