# Fraud Detection Engine

## Overview
The Fraud Detection Engine is the core module responsible for identifying suspicious and potentially fraudulent transactions. It combines rule-based detection with machine learning models to flag anomalies and generate actionable alerts.

## Scope of Work
The Fraud Detection Engine must implement the following functionalities:

### 1. Rule-Based Detection
- **Objective**: Flag suspicious transactions based on predefined rules.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Define rules for detecting common fraud patterns (e.g., high-value transactions, unusual account activity).
  - Provide a rule management interface for administrators to add, update, or delete rules.
  - Generate alerts for transactions that match rule criteria.

### 2. Machine Learning Detection
- **Objective**: Use advanced models to identify patterns and anomalies.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Train models on historical transaction data to detect unusual behavior.
  - Support supervised and unsupervised learning for different detection scenarios.
  - Continuously retrain models to improve accuracy.

### 3. Alert Prioritization and Scoring
- **Objective**: Rank alerts based on severity and risk.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Assign risk scores to flagged transactions using scoring models.
  - Prioritize alerts for investigator review based on risk scores.
  - Allow customization of prioritization criteria.

### 4. Real-Time Detection
- **Objective**: Identify and flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Integrate with the real-time transaction ingestion pipeline.
  - Ensure detection algorithms can process high volumes of transactions with low latency.
  - Provide real-time notifications for critical alerts.

### 5. False Positive Reduction
- **Objective**: Minimize unnecessary alerts to improve efficiency.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Analyze false positives and adjust rules and models accordingly.
  - Allow investigators to provide feedback on alert quality.
  - Implement adaptive thresholds for detection rules.

### 6. Detection Performance Metrics
- **Objective**: Monitor the effectiveness of detection mechanisms.
- **Features to Implement**:
  - Track detection rates, false positives, and model accuracy.
  - Generate periodic reports on detection performance.
  - Enable logging and monitoring for troubleshooting.

## Developer Requirements
To implement the Fraud Detection Engine, developers should:
1. **Understand Fraud Patterns**:
   - Study common fraud scenarios and AML typologies.

2. **Design Detection Pipelines**:
   - Build modular pipelines for rule-based and machine learning detection.

3. **Integrate with Other Modules**:
   - Ensure seamless integration with the Transaction Repository and Alert Management System.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Validate rules and models against historical datasets.
   - Simulate various fraud scenarios to evaluate detection accuracy.

## Technology Recommendations
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-Learn for machine learning.
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for real-time detection pipelines.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for storing rules and configurations.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus and Grafana for performance metrics.

## Deliverables
- A fully operational Fraud Detection Engine with rule-based and ML-based detection.
- APIs for configuring rules and retrieving alerts.
- Real-time detection capabilities with minimal latency.
- False positive reduction mechanisms.
- Documentation for rules, models, and integration points.
