### Why a Shared Storage System is Preferred for PostgreSQL and Neo4j Integration

A **shared storage system**, such as **Elasticsearch**, acts as an intermediary between **PostgreSQL** (relational database) and **Neo4j** (graph database), providing unified access to data indexed from both sources. While PostgreSQL excels in handling structured data and Neo4j is optimized for graph-based relationships, neither is inherently designed to efficiently query or aggregate data across both domains. A shared storage system enables seamless integration, bridging these capabilities.

---

### **Reasons for Preferring Shared Storage**

1. **Unified Query Capability**:
   - PostgreSQL handles relational queries well but struggles with traversing complex networks of relationships.
   - Neo4j is excellent for graph traversals but lacks relational data aggregation capabilities.
   - A shared system like Elasticsearch allows querying data from both sources simultaneously, abstracting their differences.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - For high-speed analytics and real-time search, querying directly from PostgreSQL or Neo4j may be computationally expensive.
   - Elasticsearch indexes data for optimized search and aggregation, ensuring faster response times for complex queries.

3. **Data Transformation and Enrichment**:
   - PostgreSQL and Neo4j store data in different formats; a shared storage system provides a unified schema for search and reporting.
   - Indexed data in Elasticsearch can include pre-aggregated fields or enriched data (e.g., computed risk scores) that are difficult to query directly from source databases.

4. **Cross-Domain Insights**:
   - Investigative and analytical workflows often require data from both relational (PostgreSQL) and graph (Neo4j) domains. A shared layer facilitates these insights without requiring direct joins or complex integration logic.

5. **Decoupling**:
   - Elasticsearch decouples analytical workloads from transactional operations in PostgreSQL and Neo4j, reducing performance bottlenecks on the source systems.

### **Examples of Usage**

#### **1. Unified Customer Search**
   **Scenario**:
   - A compliance officer searches for a customer by name to investigate:
     - KYC details (PostgreSQL)
     - Transaction history (PostgreSQL)
     - Associated counterparties and suspicious networks (Neo4j).

   **Without Shared Storage**:
   - Separate queries must be made to PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
   - Application logic is required to combine results, increasing complexity and response time.

   **With Shared Storage**:
   - Elasticsearch stores indexed data from both PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
   - A single query to Elasticsearch returns the combined results:
     - KYC data from PostgreSQL indices.
     - Counterparty networks from Neo4j indices.
   - This allows for seamless retrieval and faster investigation.

#### **2. Fraud Detection Dashboard**
   **Scenario**:
   - The AML team monitors transactions and networks for potential fraud.
   - They need aggregated views of:
     - High-value transactions (PostgreSQL).
     - Connections to flagged entities in a network (Neo4j).

   **Without Shared Storage**:
   - Data aggregation requires querying PostgreSQL for transaction data and Neo4j for graph relationships separately.
   - Generating real-time dashboards with combined insights is difficult due to differing query languages and data retrieval speeds.

   **With Shared Storage**:
   - Elasticsearch indexes:
     - Transaction data for real-time aggregations (e.g., high-value transactions).
     - Graph nodes and relationships for identifying risky networks.
   - Kibana (or similar tools) can visualize real-time fraud detection metrics directly from Elasticsearch.

---

#### **3. Investigative Case Workflow**
   **Scenario**:
   - An investigator traces a flagged transaction:
     - Retrieve the transaction’s details and associated accounts (PostgreSQL).
     - Map relationships to suspicious entities (Neo4j).

   **Without Shared Storage**:
   - The investigator switches between systems:
     - Query PostgreSQL for transaction details and related accounts.
     - Use Neo4j’s Cypher queries to explore suspicious relationships.
   - The manual process is time-consuming and error-prone.

   **With Shared Storage**:
   - Elasticsearch indexes transactional data and graph relationships, enabling a single investigation query:
     - Find flagged transactions and their counterparties (PostgreSQL data).
     - Trace relationships and associated risk scores (Neo4j data).
   - The investigator gains a holistic view without switching systems.

### **Benefits of Shared Storage**

#### **1. Enhanced Performance**
   - **Indexing for Speed**:
     - Elasticsearch indexes data in a manner optimized for read-intensive operations like search and analytics.
     - Reduces the load on PostgreSQL and Neo4j for complex queries.
   - **Aggregations**:
     - Elasticsearch precomputes data aggregations (e.g., totals, averages), making real-time dashboards feasible.

#### **2. Unified Search and Querying**
   - Elasticsearch provides a single query interface (via its REST API or query DSL) to access indexed data from both PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
   - Example: Search for a customer name and retrieve all relevant data (transactions, relationships, alerts) in one query.

#### **3. Simplified Data Integration**
   - **Schema Independence**:
     - Elasticsearch can normalize data structures from PostgreSQL (tabular) and Neo4j (graph) into a unified format.
   - **Reduced Application Logic**:
     - The shared layer handles the complexity of merging data from multiple sources, simplifying application development.

#### **4. Scalability**
   - Elasticsearch is horizontally scalable, allowing it to handle growing data volumes from both PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
   - Scales independently of the source systems, avoiding performance degradation.

#### **5. Decoupling Workloads**
   - Transactional workloads (e.g., inserts, updates) remain in PostgreSQL and Neo4j, while analytical and search workloads are offloaded to Elasticsearch.
   - Improves the performance and reliability of source databases.

#### **6. Real-Time Analytics**
   - Elasticsearch enables real-time insights, such as:
     - Customer risk scores.
     - Transaction anomalies.
     - Suspicious network visualization.

### **Features Enabled by Shared Storage (Not Feasible Otherwise)**

1. **Cross-Domain Insights**:
   - Combining relational and graph data in a single search query or visualization.
   - Example: Query Elasticsearch to display a customer’s KYC details (PostgreSQL) alongside their risky connections (Neo4j).

2. **Real-Time Dashboards**:
   - Generating fraud and compliance dashboards with data from both systems, updated in near real-time.
   - Without Elasticsearch, this requires complex backend logic or middleware.

3. **Global Search Across Systems**:
   - Example: A single search for a customer name returns:
     - Accounts and transactions from PostgreSQL.
     - Graph relationships and risk data from Neo4j.
   - Achieving this directly in PostgreSQL or Neo4j is infeasible due to performance and architectural differences.

4. **Unified Audit Logs**:
   - Elasticsearch can store logs of transactions and relationship traversals, providing investigators with a unified audit trail.
