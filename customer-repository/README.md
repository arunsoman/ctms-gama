2. **Design Efficient Storage**:
   - Choose a database technology that supports high read/write performance and scalability.

3. **Implement Core Functionalities**:
   - Develop APIs and search mechanisms for investigators and other modules.
   - Integrate profile enrichment pipelines with external data sources.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Create test cases for data integrity, search accuracy, and versioning.
   - Simulate large-scale data operations to test performance under load.

## Technology Recommendations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch.
- **Encryption Tools**: AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault for secure data encryption.
- **Search Tools**: Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities.

## Deliverables
- A scalable and secure Customer Information Repository.
