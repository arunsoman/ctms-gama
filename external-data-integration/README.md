# External Data Ingestion Module

## Overview

### What is External Data Ingestion?
The **External Data Ingestion Module** is responsible for integrating external data sources into the AML system. These sources include sanctions lists, politically exposed persons (PEP) databases, adverse media feeds, regulatory watchlists, and other intelligence data. This module ensures that the AML system is enriched with up-to-date and accurate information to improve detection capabilities and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Benefits of External Data Ingestion in AML
1. **Enhanced Detection**: Incorporate external intelligence to improve the accuracy of fraud and money laundering detection.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Access the latest sanctions lists, watchlists, and media feeds for timely risk mitigation.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with international and local regulations by using updated external data.
4. **Risk Scoring Integration**: Enhance customer and transaction risk scores using insights from external data.
5. **Improved Investigations**: Provide investigators with comprehensive context by linking internal data with external intelligence.

## Services Provided

1. **Sanctions and Watchlist Integration**: Fetch and update data from sanctions and regulatory watchlists.
2. **PEP Data Integration**: Retrieve and update politically exposed persons (PEP) data.
3. **Adverse Media Screening**: Integrate adverse media feeds to identify risks from negative publicity.
4. **Data Validation and Normalization**: Ensure ingested data adheres to a standardized format.
5. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Support real-time or scheduled updates from external sources.
6. **Integration with AML Knowledge Repository**: Store external data and integrate it with static rules and risk parameters.

## Integration with AML Knowledge Repository

The **AML Knowledge Repository** acts as the storage and processing hub for all external data ingested. The repository ensures that external data is consistently used across all AML subsystems.

### How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - The module ingests data from external sources, such as:
     - Sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC, UN, EU).
     - PEP databases.
     - Adverse media sources.
   - Normalizes the data into the repositoryâ€™s standard format.

2. **Rule Enrichment**:
   - Updates static rules in the repository with external data.
   - Example: A rule may include, "Flag transactions linked to entities on sanctions lists."

3. **Threshold Updates**:
   - Adjusts risk thresholds dynamically based on external data.
   - Example: Increase the risk score of customers linked to newly added high-risk regions.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Shares usage metrics and detection results with the repository to optimize data integration.
   - Example: "Entities flagged by adverse media screening resulted in 15 alerts this month."

## Detailed Breakdown of Services

### 1. **Sanctions and Watchlist Integration**
   - **Data Sources**:
     - OFAC, UN, EU, and other international sanctions lists.
     - Local regulatory watchlists and blacklists.
   - **Integration**:
     - Retrieve updates periodically or in real-time via APIs or batch files.
     - Normalize data fields such as `Entity Name`, `Country`, `Sanction Type`, and `Source`.
   - **Usage**:
     - Cross-reference transactions and customer profiles with ingested data.
     - Flag entities linked to sanctions or watchlists.

---

### 2. **PEP Data Integration**
   - **Data Sources**:
     - Global and regional PEP databases.
   - **Integration**:
     - Fetch updates via secure APIs or file transfers.
     - Standardize fields such as `Name`, `Position`, `Country`, and `PEP Type`.
   - **Usage**:
     - Enhance customer profiles with PEP status.
     - Increase risk scores for accounts linked to PEPs.

---

### 3. **Adverse Media Screening**
   - **Data Sources**:
     - Media feeds, news aggregators, and adverse publicity databases.
   - **Integration**:
     - Ingest and normalize data fields such as `Entity Name`, `Media Source`, `Publication Date`, and `Risk Type`.
     - Tag entities with risks related to fraud, corruption, or other crimes.
   - **Usage**:
     - Link adverse media findings to customer profiles and transactions.
     - Generate alerts for customers with negative media coverage.

---

### 4. **Data Validation and Normalization**
   - **Validation**:
     - Ensure all ingested data is complete and adheres to predefined schemas.
     - Detect and resolve duplicate or inconsistent records.
   - **Normalization**:
     - Standardize data formats for seamless integration into the repository.
     - Example: Convert country names to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes.

---

### 5. **Real-Time Synchronization**
   - **Real-Time Updates**:
     - Fetch and process data as it becomes available from external sources.
   - **Scheduled Updates**:
     - Support periodic updates (e.g., hourly, daily) for less time-sensitive data.
   - **Failover Mechanisms**:
     - Retry failed ingestion attempts and log errors for resolution.

---

### 6. **Integration with Other Subsystems**

#### **Fraud Detection Engine**
   - Cross-references transactions and accounts with sanctions and watchlist data.
   - Uses external data to validate fraud detection alerts.

#### **Risk Scoring Module**
   - Updates customer and transaction risk scores based on PEP status or sanctions list matches.
   - Incorporates adverse media findings into composite risk scores.

#### **Alert Management System**
   - Tags alerts with external data findings (e.g., "Linked to sanctioned entity X").
   - Generates high-priority alerts for entities flagged by multiple external sources.

#### **Case Management System**
   - Provides investigators with external data context (e.g., "This entity is on the UN sanctions list").
   - Links external data findings to historical cases for evidence.
