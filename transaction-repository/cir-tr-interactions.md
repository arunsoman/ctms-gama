How the **Customer Information Repository** and the **Transaction Repository** interact, along with their specific roles and responsibilities:

---

### **1. Roles and Responsibilities**

#### **Customer Information Repository**
- **Primary Focus**: Storing static and semi-static customer data.
- **Data Stored**:
  - Customer profiles: KYC information, addresses, contact details, risk scores, and beneficial ownership.
  - Relationship data: Links to other customers or accounts (e.g., guardians, joint account holders, corporate ownership structures).
  - Historical updates: Record of changes in customer information (e.g., address updates, risk score changes).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Provide a single view of the customer for compliance and risk assessment.
  - Support modules like **Behavioral Analytics**, **Link Analysis**, and **Case Management** with enriched customer profiles.
  - Enable customer segmentation and peer group analysis.

#### **Transaction Repository**
- **Primary Focus**: Storing dynamic, high-volume transactional data.
- **Data Stored**:
  - Transaction details: Amount, timestamp, transaction type, source, and destination accounts.
  - Transaction metadata: Channels (e.g., ATM, online), geolocation, and device information.
  - Aggregated data: Periodic summaries or metrics for reporting and analytics.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Support time-series analysis for **Temporal Analysis Module**.
  - Provide data for fraud detection and typology matching (e.g., circular fund transfers).
  - Enable regulatory reporting for high-value transactions and suspicious activities.

### **2. Interactions Between Repositories**

#### **Primary Interaction Points**:
- **Linking Customer and Transaction Data**:
  - Each transaction in the **Transaction Repository** references a customer or account stored in the **Customer Information Repository** via a unique identifier (e.g., `customerId` or `accountId`).
  - Example:
    - A transaction in the repository:
      ```json
      {
          "transactionId": "T123",
          "amount": 5000,
          "timestamp": "2024-12-01T12:00:00Z",
          "sourceAccountId": "A001",
          "destinationAccountId": "A002"
      }
      ```
    - References customer accounts in the **Customer Information Repository**:
      ```json
      {
          "accountId": "A001",
          "customerId": "C001",
          "name": "John Doe"
      }
      ```

- **Behavioral Insights**:
  - The **Behavioral Analytics Module** retrieves customer profiles from the **Customer Information Repository** and correlates them with transaction patterns from the **Transaction Repository** to identify anomalies.
  - Example: A customer categorized as "low-risk" making a sudden high-value transaction outside their typical behavior.

- **Risk Scoring**:
  - Customer risk scores are stored and updated in the **Customer Information Repository** based on patterns detected in the **Transaction Repository**.
  - Example:
    - High-frequency transactions detected in the **Transaction Repository** increase the customer's risk score in the **Customer Information Repository**.

- **Case Investigations**:
  - The **Case Management System** links flagged transactions in the **Transaction Repository** to customer profiles in the **Customer Information Repository** for a complete view during investigations.
  - Example: A flagged transaction includes the customerâ€™s KYC data, linked accounts, and transaction history.

### **3. Interaction Workflow**

#### **Data Flow Example**:
1. **Transaction Storage**:
   - A transaction is ingested and validated by the system, then stored in the **Transaction Repository**.
   - The transaction references `customerId` or `accountId` stored in the **Customer Information Repository**.

2. **Customer Risk Assessment**:
   - The **Behavioral Analytics Module** queries both repositories:
     - Fetches customer risk profile and historical behavior from the **Customer Information Repository**.
     - Retrieves recent transactions from the **Transaction Repository** to assess anomalies.
   - Results in updated risk scores in the **Customer Information Repository**.

3. **Alert Generation**:
   - The **Fraud Detection Engine** detects a suspicious pattern in the **Transaction Repository**.
   - The system enriches the alert with customer data from the **Customer Information Repository** (e.g., KYC details, linked accounts).
   - The alert is forwarded to investigators with a complete view.

4. **Regulatory Reporting**:
   - Reports for high-value transactions or suspicious activity queries both repositories:
     - **Transaction Repository**: Retrieves flagged transactions and their metadata.
     - **Customer Information Repository**: Adds customer details and risk scores.

### **4. Advantages of Separation**

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Transaction-heavy queries (e.g., detecting high-frequency patterns) run independently of customer-related queries (e.g., KYC checks), preventing performance bottlenecks.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The **Transaction Repository** can be scaled independently to handle high transaction volumes without impacting the **Customer Information Repository**.

3. **Specialized Storage and Indexing**:
   - The **Customer Information Repository** is optimized for structured customer data and relationship mapping.
   - The **Transaction Repository** is optimized for time-series data and high-speed queries.

4. **Flexible Data Retention**:
   - Different retention policies can be applied to each repository:
     - Customer data might need indefinite storage.
     - Transaction data could be archived or summarized after a specific period.

### **5. When Unified Repositories Work**
In smaller systems, a unified repository may suffice if:
- Transaction volumes are low.
- There are minimal performance concerns.
- The system serves basic use cases without complex analytics.

### Conclusion
While the **Customer Information Repository** and the **Transaction Repository** complement each other, their separation is vital for large-scale, data-intensive AML systems. It ensures optimized performance, scalability, and maintainability, supporting advanced use cases like behavioral analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance.
