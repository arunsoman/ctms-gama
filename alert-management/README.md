# Alert Management Module

## Overview

### What is the Alert Management Module?
The **Alert Management Module** serves as the central system for handling and managing alerts generated across the AML system. It consolidates alerts from various modules, categorizes them by severity and type, and provides tools for prioritization, assignment, and resolution. This module acts as a bridge between automated detection systems and human investigators.

### Benefits of the Alert Management Module
1. **Centralized Alert Repository**: Unifies alerts from all detection systems for efficient management.
2. **Prioritization**: Enables efficient triaging by categorizing alerts based on severity and risk.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Provides detailed context for alerts, including linked transactions, entities, and rules.
4. **Investigation Workflow Support**: Streamlines the handoff of alerts to investigators or the case management system.
5. **Audit and Compliance**: Maintains a complete log of alerts and actions for regulatory purposes.

## Scope

The **Alert Management Module** encompasses the following core responsibilities:
1. **Alert Ingestion**:
   - Accept alerts from various detection systems, including the **Fraud Detection Engine**, **Behavioral Analytics Module**, and **Temporal Analysis Module**.
2. **Alert Categorization**:
   - Categorize alerts by type, severity, and associated risk scores.
3. **Alert Prioritization**:
   - Automatically rank alerts based on predefined criteria or dynamic scoring.
4. **Alert Tracking**:
   - Maintain a lifecycle for each alert (e.g., New → In Progress → Resolved).
5. **Alert Assignment**:
   - Assign alerts to investigators or escalate them for further review.
6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Provide resolved alert outcomes to detection systems for refining detection logic.

## Features and Functionalities

### 1. **Alert Ingestion**
- **Real-Time Ingestion**:
  - Receive alerts from modules like the Fraud Detection Engine via APIs or messaging queues.
- **Batch Ingestion**:
  - Process alerts from batch jobs (e.g., nightly fraud detection runs).

---

### 2. **Alert Categorization**
- **Type-Based Categorization**:
  - Classify alerts based on predefined types, such as:
    - High-Value Transactions.
    - Circular Fund Transfers.
    - Behavioral Deviations.
- **Severity Levels**:
  - Categorize alerts into Critical, High, Medium, or Low based on risk scores or thresholds.
- **Associated Metadata**:
  - Attach relevant details, such as linked transactions, customers, or rules.

---

### 3. **Alert Prioritization**
- **Dynamic Risk Scoring**:
  - Adjust alert priority based on factors like:
    - Severity level.
    - Associated entities (e.g., PEPs, sanctioned entities).
    - Transaction amount or frequency.
- **Manual Overrides**:
  - Allow investigators to adjust priorities for special cases.

---

### 4. **Alert Tracking**
- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - Track the state of each alert (e.g., New, In Progress, Escalated, Resolved).
- **Audit Logs**:
  - Maintain a history of actions taken on each alert.

---

### 5. **Alert Assignment**
- **Automated Assignment**:
  - Assign alerts to investigators based on predefined rules (e.g., severity, workload).
- **Manual Assignment**:
  - Allow supervisors to manually reassign alerts.
- **Escalation**:
  - Automatically escalate unresolved alerts based on configurable timelines.

---

### 6. **Feedback Mechanism**
- **Case Resolution Feedback**:
  - Send resolved alert outcomes (e.g., True Positive, False Positive) to detection modules for refinement.
- **Learning System Updates**:
  - Use feedback to improve machine learning models or rule accuracy.

---

## Interactions with Other Modules

### 1. **Fraud Detection Engine**
- **Input**:
  - Alerts generated by the Fraud Detection Engine are ingested and categorized.
- **Output**:
  - Feedback on resolved alerts is sent back to refine detection models and rules.

---

### 2. **Behavioral Analytics Module**
- **Input**:
  - Behavioral anomalies flagged by this module are sent as alerts.
- **Output**:
  - Provides feedback to improve behavioral models or thresholds.

---

### 3. **Temporal Analysis Module**
- **Input**:
  - Time-based anomalies (e.g., odd-hour transactions) are forwarded as alerts.
- **Output**:
  - Feedback loops to enhance time-based detection logic.

---

### 4. **Fraudulent Activity Module**
- **Input**:
  - Sends alerts for suspicious activity to the Fraudulent Activity Module for case creation.
- **Output**:
  - Tracks investigation status and resolved outcomes for further action.

---

### 5. **Link Analysis Module**
- **Input**:
  - Alerts linked to high-risk network connections are processed and prioritized.
- **Output**:
  - Provides enriched context for alerts involving complex network patterns.

---

### 6. **Insights Dashboard**
- **Input**:
  - Displays active and resolved alerts with associated metadata.
- **Output**:
  - Allows investigators to update alert statuses directly from the dashboard.

---

### 7. **AML Knowledge Repository**
- **Input**:
  - Retrieves rules and typologies associated with alerts for context.
- **Output**:
  - Sends feedback to update or refine rules and typologies based on resolved cases.

## Example Workflow

### 1. Alert Ingestion
- The **Fraud Detection Engine** flags a high-value transaction:
  ```json
  {
      "alertId": "A12345",
      "type": "High-Value Transaction",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "linkedEntities": ["C001", "T001"],
      "ruleId": "R001"
  }
  ```

### 2. Alert Categorization
- The Alert Management Module categorizes it as:
  - Type: High-Value Transaction.
  - Severity: Critical.
  - Linked Customer: `C001`.
  - Associated Transaction: `T001`.

### 3. Alert Prioritization
- Priority is set based on:
  - Severity Level: Critical.
  - Customer Risk Score: 90 (High Risk).

### 4. Alert Assignment
- The alert is automatically assigned to `Investigator001` based on workload and severity.

### 5. Investigation
- The investigator reviews the alert using linked data from:
  - **Insights Dashboard** (customer details, transaction metadata).
  - **Link Analysis Module** (network connections).

### 6. Feedback Loop
- Outcome:
  ```json
  {
      "alertId": "A12345",
      "status": "Resolved",
      "outcome": "True Positive",
      "feedback": "Transaction involved a sanctioned entity."
  }
  ```

- Feedback is sent to the Fraud Detection Engine to refine future detections.
