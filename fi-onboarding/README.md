# FI Onboarding Module

## Overview
The FI (Financial Institution) Onboarding Module manages the seamless integration of financial institutions into the system. It provides functionalities for registration, compliance checks, role and permission setup, FI user management, and operational readiness, ensuring secure and efficient interactions with the platform.

## Features

### 1. FI Registration
- **Purpose**: Gather and manage detailed information about the financial institution during onboarding.
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Capture basic details like institution name, address, and contact information.
  - Define supported services (e.g., transactions, reporting, AML data sharing).
  - Customize forms to collect additional institution-specific details.
  - Generate unique identifiers for each FI upon successful registration.

### 2. FI User Management
- **Purpose**: Manage users within an onboarded financial institution.
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Create, update, and deactivate FI user accounts.
  - Assign roles and permissions to FI users.
  - Provide audit trails for all user activities.
  - Enable password management, including resets and expirations.
  - Support user status monitoring (e.g., active, suspended, locked).

### 3. Role and Permission Management
- **Purpose**: Set up roles and permissions for FI users.
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Predefine roles for administrators, operators, and auditors.
  - Assign permissions at granular levels (e.g., data access, reports).
  - Enable FI administrators to manage internal user roles.
  - Integrate seamlessly with `FiUser`, `FiRole`, and `FiPermission` entities.

### 4. API Key Management
- **Purpose**: Enable secure data exchange and API access.
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Generate and assign API keys to onboarded institutions.
  - Configure rate limits and IP whitelisting.
  - Monitor API usage and revoke keys when needed.

### 5. Notification and Alerts
- **Purpose**: Notify stakeholders of milestones and issues during onboarding.
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - Send notifications for onboarding stages and compliance issues.
  - Alert institutions about SLA breaches or contract expirations.

## Models

### 1. `FiUser`
- **Purpose**: Represents users associated with a financial institution.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the user.
  - `username`: Login credential for the user.
  - `password`: Encrypted password for authentication.
  - `roles`: Set of roles assigned to the user.
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-Many with `FiRole` to assign multiple roles to a user.

### 2. `FiRole`
- **Purpose**: Represents roles assigned to FI users for access control.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the role.
  - `roleName`: Name of the role (e.g., Administrator, Auditor).
  - `permissions`: Set of permissions associated with the role.
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-Many with `FiPermission` for permissions.
  - Many-to-Many with `FiUser` for user-role assignments.

### 3. `FiPermission`
- **Purpose**: Represents granular access permissions within the system.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the permission.
  - `permissionName`: Name of the permission (e.g., View Reports, Manage Users).
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-Many with `FiRole` to assign permissions to roles.
