# Risk Scoring Module
The **Risk Scoring Module** plays a crucial role in assessing the risk levels of entities (customers, accounts, transactions, etc.) and enables real-time and batch evaluation.
## Services Provided:

1. **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Assign risk scores to transactions, customers, and accounts based on predefined parameters (e.g., transaction value, frequency, location).
2. **Customizable Scoring Models**: Allow configuration of scoring criteria and thresholds by administrators.
3. **Real-time Scoring**: Evaluate risk scores in real-time for incoming transactions.
4. **Aggregated Risk Reports**: Generate reports summarizing risk scores by FI, customer type, or region.
5. **Historical Risk Analysis**: Provide trend analysis of risk scores over time for monitoring.


#### **Core Components of the Risk Scoring Module**

1. **Risk Criteria Database**
   - Stores predefined and customizable criteria for risk evaluation (e.g., geography, transaction volume).
   - Includes regulatory guidelines, institution-specific policies, and machine-learning-derived parameters.

2. **Risk Score Calculation Engine**
   - Dynamically calculates risk scores based on configurable weights assigned to risk parameters.
   - Supports both deterministic (rule-based) and probabilistic (AI/ML-based) scoring models.

3. **Threshold Management System**
   - Defines thresholds for flagging entities as high, medium, or low risk.
   - Allows dynamic adjustments to thresholds based on trends and operational needs.

4. **Risk Factor Aggregator**
   - Aggregates multiple risk factors (e.g., customer behavior, transaction anomalies, external lists) to produce a comprehensive risk score.

5. **Audit and Logging Layer**
   - Tracks changes to scoring rules, criteria, and thresholds for auditability.
   - Maintains logs of all risk score calculations for investigations and compliance.

#### **Detailed Services of the Risk Scoring Module**

1. **Dynamic Risk Scoring Services**
   - Calculate real-time risk scores for transactions, customers, accounts, and entities.
   - Incorporate multiple dimensions such as transaction amount, frequency, location, device, and counterparties.

2. **Batch Risk Scoring**
   - Evaluate risk scores for large datasets in batch mode during scheduled runs.
   - Useful for periodic updates or processing historical data.

3. **Customizable Risk Models**
   - Allow administrators to define custom risk scoring models based on institution-specific requirements.
   - Provide a UI to configure parameters, weights, and thresholds.

4. **Multi-Level Risk Scoring**
   - Generate separate risk scores for:
     - **Customer Risk**: Based on KYC data, transaction patterns, and external sources.
     - **Transaction Risk**: Based on the attributes of individual transactions.
     - **Counterparty Risk**: Assess risk based on the parties involved in transactions.

5. **Geography-Based Risk Assessment**
   - Assign risk levels to transactions based on geolocations.
   - Use global risk lists for high-risk regions and dynamic updates.

6. **Time-Based Risk Scoring**
   - Include time-based patterns in scoring, such as transactions during odd hours or unusual spikes in activity.

7. **External Data Integration**
   - Integrate with sanctions lists, PEP databases, watchlists, and adverse media for enhanced scoring.
   - Automatically update risk scores when external data changes.

8. **Anomaly-Informed Scoring**
   - Incorporate anomalies detected by behavioral analytics, geospatial analysis, and link analysis into risk scores.
   - Highlight deviations from peer group behaviors.

9. **Risk Trend Analysis**
   - Track changes in risk scores over time for customers and accounts.
   - Identify customers whose risk scores increase or decrease significantly.

10. **Predictive Risk Assessment**
    - Use machine learning models to predict potential high-risk behavior based on historical data.
    - Include propensity scoring for suspicious activities.

11. **Risk Segmentation**
    - Categorize customers and accounts into predefined risk segments (e.g., high-net-worth individuals, dormant accounts).

12. **Visualization and Reporting**
    - Provide dashboards showing risk distribution across entities.
    - Generate detailed reports highlighting high-risk individuals, accounts, or transactions.

13. **Score Overrides and Justifications**
    - Allow investigators to manually adjust risk scores with mandatory justification.
    - Record adjustments for audit and compliance purposes.

14. **Cross-System Risk Sharing**
    - Share risk scores with other modules (e.g., Fraud Detection Engine, Alert Management System) for coordinated responses.

15. **Alert Integration**
    - Generate alerts for entities crossing high-risk thresholds.
    - Link risk scores directly to case management for further investigation.

16. **Compliance Integration**
    - Ensure risk scoring models align with regulatory frameworks (e.g., FATF, EU AMLD).
    - Provide traceable scoring logic for audits and compliance reviews.
